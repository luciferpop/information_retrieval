INDIA: India sees big trade opportunity in East Africa.India sees big trade opportunity in East Africa.Commerce Minister Bolla Buli Ramaiah said on Tuesday that India saw a big opportunity to boost exports to East African countries after holding a trade show in Kenya this month."In East Africa there is a $1.0 billion export that we can easily catch," he told a seminar on export development in the Indian capital.He did not give further details.India said earlier this year that its exports to the entire continent of Africa totalled 20.74 billion rupees ($582 million) in 1994/95 (April-March).Ramaiah said India needed to boost infrastructure facilities if it wanted to increase its share of world trade to one percent by the year 2000 from 0.64 percent in 1995/96.Roads, ports, power and banking facilities must be improved to help exporters, Ramaiah said. Interest rates were high and credit availability was not sufficient to boost exports, he said.-- New Delhi newsroom, +91-11-3012024

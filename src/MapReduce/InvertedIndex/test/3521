INDONESIA: Indonesian priest charged with hatred of Suharto.Indonesian priest charged with hatred of Suharto.An Indonesian Catholic priest was charged on Tuesday with publicly showing hatred against President Suharto following last month's riots in Jakarta, his lawyer said.Authorities have taken more than 200 people into custody since the July 27 violence in which at least four people were killed and scores of buildings and vehicles set on fire.Lawyer Luhut Pangaribuan from the Legal Aid Institute told reporters Father Ignatius Sandyawan was questioned and charged but not arrested."Father Ignatius Sandyawan was questioned and he will appear before the police again tomorrow. Police have said he would not be arrested," Pangaribuan said.The lawyer said Sandyawan was not arrested because church officials had guaranteed his presence at his trial.He said Sandyawan was questioned for more than three hours and also faced three further charges -- showing enmity against the authorities, publicly insulting the authorities in writing and harbouring criminals.Sandyawan was not available for comment.Officials have accused Sandyawan of sheltering three members of the leftist People's Democratic Party (PRD), including its leader Budiman Sudjatmiko.The PRD has been blamed for instigating the riots.Showing hatred against the president carries a maximum penalty of six years' imprisonment.Sandyawan is the secretary of a team of volunteers set up to assist victims of the riots, the worst unrest in the city for more than two decades.The riots erupted after police stormed the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party and evicted supporters of ousted party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of the late founding president Sukarno.Pangaribuan, who was with the priest during the questioning, said Sudjatmiko, using a false name, had called on Sandyawan after the riots and sought shelter."Sandyawan told the that police he, as a religious man, had a moral obligation to help people who felt scared," he said.The priest later put up the PRD members at the home of his brother, Benny Sumardi. Sumardi, also accused of harbouring criminals, was arrested along with the activists last week.A spokesman for the Legal Aid Institute, Munir, told Reuters on Tuesday authorities had charged 13 activists, including PRD members, with subversion in connection with the riots.Indonesia's subversion laws allow for detention for up to one year without trial and are punishable by death.

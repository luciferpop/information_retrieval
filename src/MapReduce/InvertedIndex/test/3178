ANGOLA: Angola predicts unchanged 5,000-tonne coffee crop.Angola predicts unchanged 5,000-tonne coffee crop.Angola's National Coffee Institute (INCA) has forecast a 5,000-tonne coffee harvest for 1996, unchanged from last year's production.INCA Director Manuel Dias told the state news agency Angop the figure was, however, not an accurate reflection of total production since many coffee-growing areas were still under the control of the former UNITA rebel movement.Angola produced over 200,000 tonnes of coffee in the early 1970s but production came to standstill when a 20-year civil war started between government and UNITA forces, after independence from Portugal.Many of the plantations have stood untouched since the war, which ended with the signing of a peace pact in 1994, due to a lack of financial resources.Angola liberalised its coffee sector in 1991/92 but the state defines policy and quality control through INCA.Dias said $12 million was necessary to rehabilitate 90,000 hectares of coffee plantations, of which 30,000 was for private business operators.

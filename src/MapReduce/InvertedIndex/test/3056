UK: EU may opt for IGC fudge-British think-tank.EU may opt for IGC fudge-British think-tank.European Union leaders charting the way forward for the bloc are likely to agree to the catch-all concept of "flexibility", a leading British think-tank warned on Wednesday.But a general enabling clause is not likely to be accepted in inter-governmental conference (IGC) negotiations. Instead, "flexibility" is likely to be incorporated in the EU treaty on a case-by-case basis.The main reason is that the term means different things to the EU's political leaders."In the initial stages of the inter-governmental conference "flexibility" has appeared as the big idea in the discussions," Frank Vibert, director of the European Policy Forum, wrote in a pamphlet.But he said the terms masked a division between member states wanting a looser Europe and those believing flexibility would enable an inner core of countries to pioneer new ways of extending the powers of  Community institutions.Vibert noted that French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major all support "flexibility"."Each means something different," he wrote.Major has claimed credit in Britain for negotiating the country's right to opt out of two key EU policies -- the "Social Chapter' which is designed to lay down basic employment rights, and the planned single currency.France and Germany are members of the so-called Schengen group linking 10 of the EU's member states which is designed to promote freedom of movement by abolishing border controls.However, said Vibert, the two countries disagree over control of the EU, with Germany seeing the European Commission developing into a government of Europe but France wanting power to remain with the Council of Ministers."The limitation of concepts such as flexibility...is that they may lead to agreements between governments which are simply viewed as fudge," Vibert said.He said parliaments and public opinion might not accept political fudges on matters of great importance to them. "It is an illusion to think that great differences about the shape of European political union can be contained for much longer."Vibert said flexibility might be used to allow certain member states to cooperate in new areas, for instance the tackling of crime.But in each instance, hard questions must be faced about about whether EU finance should be committed and whether the bloc's institutions should become involved.Copies of the report -- "Structured Flexibility in the European Union" -- are available from the European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Ann's Gate, London SW1A 9AA, England.

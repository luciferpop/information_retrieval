PERU: Peru set to let Fujimori run for president again.Peru set to let Fujimori run for president again.The constitutional committee of Peru's congress approved Tuesday a proposal that opens the way for President Alberto Fujimori to stand for a third consecutive term in office in the country's presidential elections in 2000."With this project we are making it possible for the best candidate, whether that is Fujimori or not, to have the option of entering a future electoral process," said Jorge Trelles, who sits on the constitutional committe and forms part of the government's alliance in congress.  Under Peruvian law, a president, who has been elected for two consecutive terms in office, cannot run in the following election.But the congressional committee, where the government has a majority, voted Tuesday 9-6 in favor of a interpretation that means Fujimori's first term in office will not be taken into account should he wish to stand for re-election.Fujimori was elected president in 1990 and again in 1995. But after he dissolved parliament in 1992, a new constitution was written the following year by a reformulated congress.  The congressional committee upheld Tuesday that only elections under the new constitution had validity when an incumbent president wished to put himself forward as a candidate for the next term.The government proposal will now be put on Thursday to a vote of congress' full chamber, where the government's comfortable majority is expected to approve the constitutional committee's interpretation.-- Saul Hudson, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134 REUTER SH

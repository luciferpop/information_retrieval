NEW ZEALAND: Wellington power companies merger to cost 200 jobs.Wellington power companies merger to cost 200 jobs.More than 200 jobs will go when the Wellington region's two power companies merge, chief executive designate of the merged group Mike Underhill said in an interview on Wednesday with the Evening Post newspaper.Underhill, who will head the new merged company TransAlta New Zealand Ltd, confirmed he has told staff to expect 40 percent redundancies if, as expected, EnergyDirect shareholders agree to the merger with Capital Power.The shareholders are due to meet on September 12 to consider the merger, which would be effective from October 1 if approved.Underhill said cuts would affect all departments.  "There aren't any obvious areas where it would be double that or half that,"  he said.EnergyDirect and Capital Power have 530 staff between them.  A 40 percent cut would reduce that by about 212. Most staff would know within three months how many jobs would remain in their departments.Underhill said the emphasis was on ending uncertainty as soon as possible. Staff would be offered voluntary redundancy, but that would not apply to everybody.  EnergyDirect is 41 percent owned by Canadian company TransAlta and 20 percent owned by community trusts which have said that they support the merger. Capital Power is owned by TransAlta.-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

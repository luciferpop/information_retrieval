CHILE: Chile plans curbs on 1997 government spending.Chile plans curbs on 1997 government spending.Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said the government's spending increase next year will be less than the economic growth rate, and vowed to place a high priority on social programs."There is an implicit commitment that this (lower government spending growth) will occur," Aninat told reporters after a meeting with President Frei to discuss the 1997 budget."We aim to reaffirm and justly give priority to social programs within a framework which clearly must respect the development of economic conditions."  Analysts have forecast the central bank's credit-squeeze, which has been in force for nearly a year, will slow economic growth to around five percent in 1997 from over seven percent this year.The finance ministry has asked the Chilean Copper Commission, a government studies center, and state copper producer Codelco to send three estimates of average copper prices next year, said Aninat.Copper sales are a key budget item. They account for for 40 percent of the country's exports.  The government must by law send the budget to Congress before the end of September.Aninat said Monday's increase in kerosene and diesel prices would not pose a threat to the government's target of cutting inflation to 6.5 percent this year."We estimate (the threat) to be very minimal as the effect will be reflected in two months," said Aninat."Our preliminary estimates point to the impact on comsumer prices of less than 0.1 percent in cumulative terms."The government jacked up kerosene prices 10 pesos a liter and diesel by five pesos as the result of a rise in international oil prices.

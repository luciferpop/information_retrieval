UK: N. Irish police to reroute march by Protestants.N. Irish police to reroute march by Protestants.Police in Northern Ireland said on Tuesday they would prevent Protestants from marching through a Catholic area of Belfast for fear that it could spark off fresh sectarian violence in the troubled city.Police said that Sunday's planned march by the Royal Black Preceptory order, a fiercely pro-British organisation, would not be allowed to pass through the staunchly pro-Irish nationalist lower Ormeau Road area of Belfast.Catholics feel threatened and insulted by Protestant marchers, many commemorating historical military victories over Catholic forces.Protestants who want the province to remain British regard marches as an essential expression of their loyalty to the crown. Police attempts to block a Protestant parade in July provoked the worst riots seen in the province for years.A tense weekend of demonstrations two weeks ago ended peacefully when a Protestant march was allowed to pass through a largely Catholic village after a lengthy stand-off.Commentators from both sides of the divide said the way in which the incident was handled had revived hopes for multi-party negotiations on the future of the province which resume in September.

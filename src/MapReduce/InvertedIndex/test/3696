USA: R.I. finds tax-free commercial paper a winner.R.I. finds tax-free commercial paper a winner.Rhode Island General Treasurer Nancy Mayer said on Tuesday she finds issuing tax- free commercial paper has allowed the fiscally challenged state to plan its cash flows and save an extra $500,000."We started with tax-free commercial paper this year and it certainly allows us to plan our cash flows much more carefully," Mayer said in a State House interview. "In the past, we issued large amounts of TANs (tax anticipation notes) whether we needed all the money or not."These we can issue as needed and that's very advantageous when interest rates are falling," Mayer said, speaking even as the Federal Open Market Committee met in Washington.The first $38 million worth of Rhode Island tax-free commercial paper was brought to market last month and sold for 3.55 percent. A few weeks earlier, the state had done a $70 million issue of TANs which carried a 3.875 percent rate.Goldman, Sachs & Co was senior manager on both deals. "We estimate that the tax-free commercial paper will net us savings of $560,000 over the next year," said Mayer's spokesman Steven Klamkin.The Legislature has authorized Mayer to issue up to $140 million in the tax-free commerical instrument.--617-367-4142

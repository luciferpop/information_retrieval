AUSTRALIA: RTRS-No Australian review from budget - Moody's.RTRS-No Australian review from budget - Moody's.Moody's Investors Service said the Australian government's 1996/97 budget, announced earlier on Tuesday, was not enough to prompt a review of the country's AA2 foreign-currency credit rating.But fiscal tightening, such as that announced by Treasurer Peter Costello, was seen as generally positive, Moody's managing director of sovereign risk David Levy told Reuters by telephone from New York."We certainly view fiscal tightness as a general positive in this situation but one budget doesn't generally move ratings by itself," Levy said.  The budget implemented A$3.9 billion in savings for the fiscal year to June 1997, which Treasury said would cut the underlying budget deficit to A$5.6 billion.The underlying budget balance -- which excludes asset sales -- would be in surplus in 1998/99, Treasury estimated."From our perspective the fiscal situation has generally always been a positive for Australia," Levy said."It has very low ratio of debt to GDP among OECD countries so that has not been the main weight of our concerns occasionally about Australia has ever been really located," he said.  "Our concern has been more on the external sector -- the balance of payments and so forth," Levy said."This is something we will factor in along with all the other factors but in and of itself one budget doesn't normally move a rating," he said.The A$20 billion forecast for the 1996/97 current account deficit and other government forecasts appeared to be realistic, he said.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

"On today's results, just how quickly the housing and construction sectors are cooling remains uncertain," the economists said."There is still uncertainty as to exactly how quickly activity and price pressures in the construction sector are abating. Today's result is consistent with our view of no monetary policy easing in September."-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

UK: LCE coffee ends mixed, U.S. stocks largely ignored.LCE coffee ends mixed, U.S. stocks largely ignored.London robusta coffee futures ended mixed after choppy trade steered by New York but outright volume was weak, traders said.A large pile of coffee stocks pending approval at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange caused little concern after two subsequent drops in certified stocks.News that a hefty 19,000 bags of coffee were awaiting Exchange certification exerted some pressure on the key Sept/Dec switch early in the session but the market then firmed.Traders said while the September premium held it could continue to attract coffee for delivery.But two days before the New York delivery period begins, the open position remained well above certified stocks. London delivery begins on September 1.In London, the second-month benchmark November ended $4 lower at $1,653 a tonne after trading between $1,640 and $1,665. September closed up $3 at $1,680 and volume totalled 5,283 lots including large AA volume on September.The Sept/Nov spread was trading at $20-25 in the afternoon.Traders noted scale-up selling although neither origins nor industry were cited. Funds were also sidelined.The consolidation was seen in line with technical signals which suggested a need to correct overbought RSI levels after last week's rally. But analysts expect the upward trend to resume.-- Clelia Oziel, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072

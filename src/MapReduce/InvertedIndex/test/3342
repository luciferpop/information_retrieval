Without the measures, he warned the deficit would be $6.6 billion.  The Economy Ministry said Fernandez will meet the IMF mission on Friday.The government said it would send the measures to Congress later Tuesday, although Oscar Lamberto, chairman of the lower house's Budget and Finance Committee said they would not become law until end-September or early October.Traders said because no major new developments were expected this week, the market might remain flat.

BELGIUM: CURTAINS FOR OLD-STYLE BELGIAN 100 FRANC NOTE.CURTAINS FOR OLD-STYLE BELGIAN 100 FRANC NOTE.Belgium's National Bank will begin removing its old-style 100-franc banknote from circulation from September 2 ahead of a definitive phase-out on December 16, it said in a statement on Wednesday.The notes, first issued on April 5, 1978, depict the nineteenth century architect, Hendrik Beyaert, a champion of the so-called Eclectic Movement which combined styles from different periods in one building.Beyaert (1823-1894) designed the Bank's Brussels and Antwerp headquarters as well as the "Petit Sablon" park in Brussels.After the phase-out date, notes will be exchangeable only at the National Bank's own counters.The notes have already begun to be replaced by ones depicting Belgian painture and caricaturist James Ensor whose paintings used bizarre and fantastic images as symbols of the evils of society.

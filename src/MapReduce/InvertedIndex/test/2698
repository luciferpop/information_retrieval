USA: U.S. STOCKS MIXED IN VERY SLOW TRADING.U.S. STOCKS MIXED IN VERY SLOW TRADING.Stocks were mixed in the second slowest trading day of the year Monday as markets braced for a crucial Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday.Bonds fell on widespread expectations that the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would leave short-term interest rates alone. The dollar ended mixed against major currencies in advance of the Fed meeting, as well as Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank on German interest rates.Crude oil prices, boosted by strong demand for heating oil, bubbled to a four-month high, topping $23 per barrel.On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.99 points to 5,699.44. The Nasdaq index was off 2.74 points at 1,130.91.In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,225 to 1,030 on volume of 294 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the second slowest turnover this year after 281.6 million shares July 29.Analysts said the higher close for blue-chip stocks was propelled by gains in transportation, oil and gold stocks."It's a very, very quiet day," said Harry Laubscher, analyst at Tucker Anthony. "Everyone is sitting on the sidelines, seeing what the Fed will do."Robert Stovall of Stovall/Twenty-First voiced analysts' consensus prediction on the Fed meeting, saying, "I believe the Fed has concluded it will not do anything, and that's contributing to the low volume. People don't want to make a major move before the Fed meeting."Laubscher said while he saw no strong trends in Monday's trading, he believed the market still had room to rise. "There's a good chance it could go higher from here," he said.One of the strongest sectors was oil stocks, helped by the strong gains in oil prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude oil rose 60 cents to $23.26 a barrel, the highest price since mid-April.Airline stocks racked up impressive gains after the carriers, led by Continental Airlines, said they were raising domestic air fares by at least 10 percent.On New York's Commodity Exchange, the active December gold contract closed up $1 at $392.40 an ounce, helping push gold shares higher.But the strength of some sectors could not shake the stockmarket out of its seasonally slow summer period."You're seeing the market on vacation now," said Stovall. "It's mid-August, we're between political conventions ... and the market tends to be drifting."The bond market was mostly quiet on the eve of the Fed meeting. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 12/32, or $3.75 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.80 percent to 6.77 percent on Friday.While currency traders also expected the Fed to keep interest rates steady, there was less certainty about what the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, would do when it meets Thursday."What the market is focusing on right now is the upcoming Bundesbank meeting," said Dorit Ronnen, a foreign exchange trader at Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York.In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.4880 German marks, down from 1.4930 marks Friday. The U.S. currency rose slightly to 107.80 Japanese yen from 107.70 yen.In overseas markets, the London Stock Exchange's FTSE 100 index neared a new record high of 3,877.9 early in trading but slipped back to end the day 9.2 points lower at 3,863.7. The Tokyo market's key Nikkei average rose 272.41 points, or 1.31 percent, to 21,106.41 in light trading.

FRANCE: EU early season grain export figures down sharply.EU early season grain export figures down sharply.Latest European Union data show grain export commitments between July 1 and August 6 of the new 1996/97 (July/June) campaign were sharply below year-ago levels, member country officials said on Tuesday.The figures, based on delivered export certificates, showed grain sales plunged to 1.432 million tonnes from 4.206 million.Commercial wheat exports, which are still subject to an export tax, fell to 183,000 tonnes from 1.919 million tonnes, but heavy export commitments to China had inflated wheat export figures at the start of the previous 1995/96 campaign.  Flour export commitments, however, reached 804,000 tonnes against 743,000 tonnes during the same period last year.Commercial barley exports stood at 205,000 tonnes against 632,000 tonnes.Since August 6, the EU has granted 94,250 tonnes of soft wheat, 3,675 tonnes of barley and 2,500 tonnes of oats through its weekly grain tender system.--Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432

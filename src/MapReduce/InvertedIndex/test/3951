UK: Finnish markka faces green rate revaluation - HGCA.Finnish markka faces green rate revaluation - HGCA.The Finnish markka faced a revaluation in the European Union's (EU) agrimonetary system as it stepped into a process of assessment for up to 50 days, the UK's Home-Grown Cereal Authority (HGCA) said.It said the green markka had an average real agrimonetary gap (RMG) of 5.205 percent with the exchange rate at the end of the 10-day reference period on Tuesday and would enter the first of possibly five confirmation periods.For a revaluation, an RMG of above five percent must be confirmed for five periods if the currency has not been devalued in the last three years.Green rates are used in calculating EU farm subsidies in terms of national currencies and have no direct impact on exchange rates.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072

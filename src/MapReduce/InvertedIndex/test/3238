RUSSIA: Russian shares close mixed in unclear trend.Russian shares close mixed in unclear trend.Leading Russian shares slipped on Tuesday with traders saying the trend was still unclear.The Russian Trade System index of 21 leading issues fell by 0.72 percent to 182.02."This week really feels like a holiday week -- a lot of clients in London are on holiday and on the continent and in New York," said Martin Diggle from Brunswick Brokerage."Shares aren't really doing anything, because there aren't many clients who really want to do anything at the moment. Most of the market is trading in a vacuum."The Russian Security Council, whose secretary is General Alexander Lebed, said on Tuesday that it doubted the authenticity of President Boris Yeltsin's latest orders on Chechnya.But the news had very little impact on share prices, traders said."I think it's a story that people will be watching to see if it develops any further," Diggle said. "It's a little bit worrying, that headline."Traders were uncertain about the possible course the market may take in the next few days."There are no flows to really shape the market," Diggle said. "I would not be surprised if we drifted around these levels in very, very thin volume."Bobby Meshoyrer, director of sales and trading at IK Aton, agreed, saying prices were most likely to stick to current levels."I think in the near future everything will keep to current levels -- no one wants to sell cheap and to buy dear," he said.At 1430 GMT Mosenergo was at $0.960 after $0.952 at Monday's close, LUKoil fell to $9.670 from $10.125, UES edged down to $0.0815 from $0.0829 and Norilsk Nickel slipped to $7.70 from $7.90.--Julie Tolkacheva, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

AUSTRALIA: RTRS-SFE wheat still quiet but options in vogue.RTRS-SFE wheat still quiet but options in vogue.Continued quiet trading in Australian wheat futures on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) surprised traders on Tuesday after Chicago's overnight gains.Ten SFE trades took place in the January 1997 contract which rose A$3.00 to A$196.00 a tonne on the sale."Bit of a surprise considering there was a sharp turnaround in Chicago, Kansas and Winnipeg wheat. We thought the January price might have risen substantially, but it was not to be," Phil Lindsay of Ord Minnett Jardine Fleming Futures Ltd said.Monday's cold snap in eastern Australia had no effect on either the crop or the market, he said.  An option deal on the SFE's overnight system SYCOM, involving 30 January A$190.00 put options at a A$10.50 premium, attracted attention.Buyers were Australian farmers interested in hedging, Lindsay said."The option market appears to be more liquid than the actual futures," Lindsay said.The equivalent of about 6,500 tonnes of wheat would have traded in options last night.

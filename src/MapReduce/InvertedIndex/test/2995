In south Texas, where summer-like temperatures continue, prices rose by about one cent into the $2.04-2.09 range.Similarly in the Midcontinent region, prices climbed about two cents higher into the low-$1.90s as forecasters called for temperatures about three to six degrees Fahrenheit above-normal through Thursday.Permian basin prices also edged up about a cent to the high-$1.80s to $1.90.Cooler weather on the West Coast pressured Topock (southern California border) prices lower to about $1.90, but the brief respite from summer heat is expected to be short-lived.In the Appalachian region, traders reported closing deals in the mid-$2.20s to about $2.30. The region is anticipating slightly above-normal temperatures over the next three days.--H McCulloch, New York Power Desk +212-859-1628

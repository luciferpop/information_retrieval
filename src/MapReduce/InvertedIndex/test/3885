PAKISTAN: Pakistan says India's veto exposes its "designs".Pakistan says India's veto exposes its "designs".Pakistan on Tuesday's condemned India's veto against a nuclear test ban treaty and said its neighbour and arch-foe had exposed its "nefarious designs" to pursue nuclear and ballistic missile plans.A foreign ministry spokesman, quoted by the official APP news agency, accused India of sabotaging the proposed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at the U.N.-sponsored Disarmament Conference in Geneva and said New Delhi "has proved that it will brook no impediment to the pursuit of its nuclear and ballistic programmes".Pakistan, regarded as a nuclear threshold state like India, has said it will not sign the CTBT unless New Delhi does likewise.The Pakistani spokesman said Islamabad had repeatedly warned the international community about "India's nuclear and hegemonistic ambitions.""This Indian 'veto' exposes yet again these nefarious designs which cannot be veiled any longer by moralistic arguments," he said."India has again shown that it is against all meaningful steps to promote nuclear non-proliferation whether at the global or the regional or bilateral levels."The international community will undoubtedly take serious cognizance of this grim reality which Pakistan of course cannot ignore."

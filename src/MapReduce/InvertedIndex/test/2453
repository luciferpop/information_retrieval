SINGAPORE: Singapore exports surprise with 6.4 pct July rise.Singapore exports surprise with 6.4 pct July rise.Singapore non-oil domestic exports, confounding most expectations, bounced back in July, surging 6.4 percent after dropping 6.1 percent in June, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Tuesday.Non-oil exports expanded to Singapore $7.28 billion (US$ 5.16 billion) in nominal terms.The figures were completely out of line with forecasts by leading economists. A Reuters poll of eight economists had early predicted a nominal year-on-year fall of 1.7 percent."Non-oil exports performed much better than expected. On the surface it looks good, but it is a volatile figure on a month-to-month basis," said Albert Tan, an economist with J.M. Sassoon.The TDB said non-oil domestic exports to the United States, Singapore's largest market, and Japan continued to increase but at a more moderate rate at 7.2 percent and 13.7 percent respectively.The increase in sales to the United States was mainly in disk drives, integrated circuits, and printers amongst other electronic items.However, exports of computer parts and peripherals and radios declined.Exports to Europe also shrank, by 2.6 percent, while exports to Malaysia and Hong Kong also remained weak, said TDB.However, non-oil domestic exports to South Korea and China maintained strong growth, expanding by 24.8 percent and 17.9 percent respectively.- Singapore Newsroom 65-8703080

UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher.Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher.Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said.Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce.Silver was indicated at $5.20 an ounce, up eight cents from Monday's London close and its highest price since June 19.It eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight.But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week."There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said.Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements.An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date."It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," the dealer added.Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices noted that the rally could run into selling at silver's 200-day moving average price of $5.33 per ounce.In contrast, bullion fixed at just $387.10 an ounce, versus $386.40 on Monday afternoon and $386.25 in the morning."Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said.But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher."Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390," said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge."But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur," she added.Some analysts said gold was being cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Open market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York later on Tuesday in case of surprises regarding interest rates.Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand."There's been some (South African gold) producer selling with the weaker rand," a dealer said, referring to the currency's overnight slump to 4.59 to the U.S. dollar.Palladium was slightly firmer, up $0.60 at $124.65 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows. But dealers were disappointed palladium had not absorbed more strength from silver.The same was true for platinum, which was up just $1.10 at $399.50, dealers said.

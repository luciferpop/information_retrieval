AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australia eyes alternative equity market.RTRS-Australia eyes alternative equity market.Australia's government committed about A$1.4 million in the 1996/97 budget for research into establishing an equity market for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including start-ups, Industry, Science and Tourism minister John Moore said on Tuesday.A further A$1.12 million would be spent on implementing the alternative market in the following two years, he said .Access to capital is currently  a major problem for small and medium-sized companies, Moore said in a statement.  "This may be due partly to the fact that SMEs have limited access to a formal market for the buying and selling of stocks or shares to raise equity capital," Moore said.However, he acknowledged that barriers exist to establishing a market specifically for this group."The size of the Australian market may constrain liquidity and the quality of the listings," Moore said.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

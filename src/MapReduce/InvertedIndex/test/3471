"Initially, the young girl rang her father on Saturday calmly, but later telephoned back and said she had been attacked and then the telephone went dead," a police spokeswoman in Cairns told Reuters.However police late on Tuesday said they had since received some telephone calls that the three may have been inquiring about work north of Cairns."We have not come up with anything positive yet, but our initial fears have eased," said a police officer in Cairns."We will have more information on Wednesday."

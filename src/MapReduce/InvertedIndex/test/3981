UK: Silver glistens, but needs to clear $5.26-analysts.Silver glistens, but needs to clear $5.26-analysts.Silver still needed to clear $5.26 per ounce to push even higher after rallying to 2-1/2 month highs overnight, analysts said on Tuesday.A helping hand from gold, which has so far ignored silver's progress, may also be a crucial element to cement further gains in both metals, they added."Silver is not out of the woods yet. It's still a component of a trading range. But getting up past that $5.15-$5.16 area is a positive step," said chartist Cliff Green of Trend Analysis.Silver fixed at $5.2025 an ounce on Tuesday, the highest fixing since June 19, compared to $5.0825 a day earlier. Dealers attributed the rise to chart-driven fund buying.Silver had been trending lower since peaking at a fix of $5.8275 in early February. Prices have been wedged in a $5.00-$5.15 range for a month.Analyst Susan Rigg of Chart Analysis Ltd said silver's challenge to June peaks in the $5.20-$5.30 area indicated a long-absent upwards dynamic."I think now it is beginning to break the downtrend which has been in course since the beginning of the year, provided it can maintain its momentum," Rigg said.But silver faced substantial supply coming in above current levels from trading earlier this year, she added.However, clearing the $5.25 level would complete a rounding pattern, making the metal's breach of the $5.00 level in late July look like a "false breakdown", analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a commentary.Then prices could be projected as high as $5.40, she said.Green pegged silver's upside targets at $5.42 and then possibly $5.53 after clearing the $5.25-$5.26 hurdle.Several analysts, however, said gold's less than enthusiastic response may cause silver to stumble. Bullion was indicated at $387.30/$387.80 an ounce, less than $1.00 up from Monday's London close.The lack of response in gold was reminiscent of silver's failure to rally when gold made an attempt to pass $390 earlier this month, Green said."To really regenerate some interest and real momentum in these markets, we need to see gold and silver working in tandem," he added. "If gold went through $390 and silver through $5.26, then I'd be more interested in the complex as a whole."--London newsroom +44 171 542 2936

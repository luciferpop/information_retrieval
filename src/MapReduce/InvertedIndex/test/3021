USA: Australian budget trimming appears positive - S&P.Australian budget trimming appears positive - S&P.Standard & Poor's said the 1996/1997 deficit-cutting Australian budget delivered on Tuesday appears to reflect improvements in the country's fiscal health."It does appear, on the surface, to be a significant fiscal tightening," said Roger Scher, assistant director of Standard & Poor's sovereign ratings group.Scher said he reserved judgement on a review of the current AA foreign currency rating pending further study of the budget. He said the trend could be positive, however.  "There are substantial spending cuts," Scher said, adding "improvements in public finances of this nature, that persist over the medium term, could only mean improvements in the commonwealth's creditworthiness."Australia's new conservative government announced it would run a A$5.6 billion (US$4.4 billion) underlying deficit for the fiscal year to June 30, 1997. The budget trimmed A$3.9 billion from hundreds of government programs in order to achieve the savings.The projected A$5.6 billion underlying deficit is less than half the A$10.3 billion shortfall in 1995/1996. The 1996/1997 headline result, which takes all figures into account, is a A$474 million surplus.--Al Yoon, 212-859-1672

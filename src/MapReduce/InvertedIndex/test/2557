GERMANY: German company failures up 15 pct in 96-Hermes.German company failures up 15 pct in 96-Hermes.Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG, Germany's biggest credit insurer, said it expects 25,000 company insolvencies during the current year.The insurer said on Tuesday that this would represent a 15 percent rise in bankruptcies compared to the previous year.On the European level the outlook was worsening as well. Hermes said it expected a six percent increase in bankruptcies in Europe this year. In 1995 the number stagnated.The Hermes forecast came despite its expectations of an upswing in the European economy during the second half of 1996.Hermes said this was due to the momentum given to the economy by monetary policy, in particular by low interest rates.Hermes said it recorded an 11 percent increase in premium income to 438 million marks ($294 million) during the first half of this year.At the same time the volume of claims increased. Hermes said bankruptcies of big companies such as shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan Verbund and construction group Maculan were responsible for this development.--Hannfried von Hindenburg, Frankfurt Newsrom +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.489 German Marks)

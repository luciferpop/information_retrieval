COLOMBIA: Colombian peso extends rally, closes at 1,038.15.Colombian peso extends rally, closes at 1,038.15.Colombia's peso extended last Friday's gains in active trading on the country's interbank market, closing up 9.85 pesos on the dollar at 1,038.15."It was a volatile session," one dealer said, noting that peso had weakened early in the day as oversold banks and the public sector demanded dollars.It swung back up ahead of the close, however, on what dealers described as a flood of dollar sales by oil and coffee exporters.Financial markets were closed Monday in observance of a national religious holiday.  The peso, which gained eight pesos on the dollar Friday, traded in a 1,035.50 to 1,047.60 range in Tuesday's trade and dealers reported a high-than-average 437 trades for a total of $176 million.The peso has appreciated significantly since late June when it traded around 1,070 to the dollar.The rise -- which makes Colombian goods including coffee more expensive abroad -- has prompted the government to urge the central bank to weaken the peso as part of a bid to shore up the export sector and and refuel flagging economic growth.  The central bank, which is fiercely independent and likes a stronger currency as a curb against inflation, has insisted that it will not alter the exchange rate bands it sets daily to undercut the peso to the administration's tune.-- Juan Guillermo Londono, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944

MALAYSIA: Malaysia overnight rate rises on intervention.Malaysia overnight rate rises on intervention.The overnight interbank rate was at 7.5 percent around 0645 GMT against 6.00/10 at close on Monday, dealers said on Tuesday.They said the market was tight after Bank Negara intervened in the money market to borrow for a one-month deposit at 6.95 to 7.05 percent against 6.95 at its previous auction.  The dealers said rates could rise further by the close  of the day, though that would depend on the volume of funds taken in by Bank Negara."Going by the rates at which it has taken money, it looks like (Negara) has cleaned out the market. It has covered the entire range in which one-month was being traded," said the head of money dealing at a foreign bank.Earlier, other interbank rates rose by 10-20 basis points immediately after the intervention.They said one-month interbank rose to 7.10/15 percent against 7.00/05 before the intervention.  One-week money was at 6.80/00 percent against 6.50/60 and two-week at 6.90/00 against 6.60/70.There were gains in longer-term rates too. The three-month interbank rate was up at 7.20/25 against 7.15/18 in early trading and six-month money rose to 7.25/30 against 7.23/25.Earlier, Bank Negara Malaysia returned to the market after nearly three months to borrow for a one-month deposit at 6.95 to 7.05 percent against 6.95 previously.Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the local interbank market to keep a check on liquidity or set interest rates as part of its efforts to fight inflation.  But it has not been in the market since May 24, despite rising liquidity that has pressured rates downward, threatening to thwart the Bank's tight monetary policy.Money market dealers said the intervention indicated that Bank Negara has not eased its tight monetary policy.While the volume that Bank Negara took was not known, it appears to have given a psychological boost to interest rates, particularly short-term rates, dealers said.- Madhav Reddy (603-230 8911)

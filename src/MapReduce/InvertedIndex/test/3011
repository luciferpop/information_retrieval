USA: No major reversal in Japan trade picture -- Stiglitz.No major reversal in Japan trade picture -- Stiglitz.White House economic adviser Joseph Stiglitz said Tuesday he sees no major reversal in the improvement of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.Asked by a reporter if he could imagine the trade deficit returning to the $50-$60 billion levels of several years ago, Stiglitz replied, "I don't see a major reversal of that kind."  Stiglitz said two factors should continue to help the trade picture -- the trade agreements negotiated with Japan and that country's economic recovery."I don't think that we have reached the full benefits of the trade agreements," he said. "It's also the case that Japan's recovery is still in (its) early stages, and if its recovery continues, that should also be good for our exports to Japan."He added, "The underlying fundamentals are such that there should be -- relative to where the Japan deficit was -- continued strength."  Stiglitz, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, suggested the U.S. trade deficit with China could worsen this year."It would be surprising if it were lower than last year's," the official said.The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that the overall U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically in June, dropping 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May.The trade shortfall with China swelled 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion. It surpassed for the first time the $3.24 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which was up 3.6 percent from May.

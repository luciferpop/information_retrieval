USA: WLR Foods cuts costs, sees price pressure.WLR Foods cuts costs, sees price pressure.Poultry producer WLR Foods Inc said Tuesday it had implemented cost-cutting initiatives that should save the company $20 million on an annualized basis.A company spokeswoman said the actions included reducing the WLR's workforce to about 8,500 currently from 9,200 in January through attrition and job consolidation.WLR's cost-cutting measures also included product line consolidation and its previously-announced plan to close its Wampler-Longacre Inc plant in Charlotte, N.C.  "I am pleased that on an annualized basis we initiated $20 million in permanent cost reductions before year-end which are already beginning to impact our bottom line," Chief Executive James Keeler said in WLR's fourth-quarter earnings release.He said prices for WLR products will continue to be under pressure until oversupplies of beef slow. He said beef producers are reacting to high grain prices by liquidating their herds."This has flooded an already competitive market with lower-priced beef and is predicted to do so at least through the winter, reducing the comparative advantage enjoyed by poultry," he said.WLR reported a fourth-quarter loss of $6.8 million, or $0.38 per share, after higher grain costs, compared to a profit of $807,000, or $0.05 per share, a year earlier.Analysts' consensus estimate was a loss of $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter, ended June 29, according to First Call.WLR fell 3/8 to 11-1/2 in morning trade.-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610

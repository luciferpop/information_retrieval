USA: Teamsters strike Hertz ahead of Chicago convention.Teamsters strike Hertz ahead of Chicago convention.Three hundred employees of car rental giant Hertz Corp went out on strike just one week before the Democratic National Convention begins here, the company said.Those wanting to rent Hertz cars will be able to do so, despite the strike, said a spokesman for Hertz, the world's largest car rental firm and a unit of Ford Motor Co.More than 20,000 people are expected to descend on Chicago next week for the August 26-29 convention.  Hertz managers were staffing customer service counters, courtesy buses and vehicle service areas left abandoned Monday by members of Teamsters Local 781, said Hertz's Joe Russo.If needed, Hertz is prepared to maintain interim staffing through the convention at the affected locations at O'Hare and Midway airports, as well as two downtown offices, he said."Our guess is the union saw some opportunity to put some pressure on Hertz with the Democratic National Convention in town and we fully anticipated that," said Russo by telephone from Hertz headquarters in New Jersey.The 300 employees have been working without a contract since December 1995. Negotiations apparently stumbled over work rules and the two sides are not far apart, Russo said."The strike came as a bit of a surprise yesterday because we thought this was an awfully attractive package," he said.The union could not be reached for comment.--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787

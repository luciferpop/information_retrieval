BRAZIL: Brazil's Franco calm about July trade deficit.Brazil's Franco calm about July trade deficit.Brazilian Central Bank Foreign Affairs Director Gustavo Franco said he was not concerned about reports the country will post a sizeable trade deficit in July or projections Brazil will end the year in the red."Taken on its own, the trade balance doesn't mean anything," he told reporters at a coffee break during a seminar at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange."It's something you have to watch, but to end the year with a small deficit doesn't mean anything," he said.  Local newspapers reported Tuesday that Brazil's Industry and Commerce Ministry would release figures showing a $350 million trade deficit for July and analyst predict a year-end gap between $1 billion and $2 billion.In the past, Franco has said the Central Bank's foreign exchange policy is flexible and that slight modifications in bank forex operations can be used to markedly improve trade figures.The ministry was expected to release Brazil's July trade balance after 1200 local time/1500 GMT.-- James Craig, Sao Paulo newsroom 5511 232 4411

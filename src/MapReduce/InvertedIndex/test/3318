BRAZIL: Brazil basic interest rate set 10 days early - paper.Brazil basic interest rate set 10 days early - paper.Brazil's Committee of Monetary Policy (Copom) is to set September's Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank (TBC) 10 days earlier than scheduled, a local financial newspaper said.The Central Bank decided to bring forward the date for setting the latest TBC because Brazil's National Monetary Council (CMN) is due to meet August 28, according to Gazeta Mercantil.  The TBC, which is used for the Central Bank's operations in the financial markets and is used as a reference rate for Central Bank rediscount lines and Proer credit lines, is adjusted every month and was first introduced in July.Financial institutions were expecting September's TBC to be lower than the 1.9 percent in the previous two months, but news of Copom's earlier-than-scheduled meeting has raised expectations that the rate might remain unchanged, Gazeta said.-- Simona de Logu, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 507 4151

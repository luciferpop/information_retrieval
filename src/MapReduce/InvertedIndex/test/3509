AUSTRALIA: Budget sets conditions for rate cut - Costello.Budget sets conditions for rate cut - Costello.Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday that the 1996/97 budget would set the conditions for another interest rate cut as long as it successfully passed through the senate.He said the budget could be knocked around in the senate, which is currently controlled by left-leaning Green and Democrat senators who have expressed opposition to many budget measures."The (Reserve) Bank has made it clear that medium term fiscal consolidation will aid that process," Costello told a news conference when asked if his 1996/97 budget increased the chance of a rate cut.  "If we can get a good budget through the senate which addresses Australia's savings problems, we can set up the conditions for that," he said, referring to a possible rate cut.Australian officials cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 7.0 percent on July 31.Costello said it was possible the budget could remove some measures from the budget, which introduced measures to cut the underlying budget deficit by A$3.9 billion to a forecast A$5.65 billion in 1996/97."The senate could knock this budget around, but if it does it's knocking around our future," he said.  "This is the once in a term, once in a decade opportunity to get it right," he said."There are a number of measures, I haven't actually quantified them, which require legislative change that the senate could defeat," he said."I hope it doesn't."The Australian dollar dropped sharply and other financial markets sold off in 1993 when the Labor government struggled to get some of its budget cutting measures through a hostile senate.-- Canberra bureau 61-2 273-2730

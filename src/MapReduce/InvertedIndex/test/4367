GERMANY: FOCUS - Bundesbank seen cutting repo rate this week.FOCUS - Bundesbank seen cutting repo rate this week.Germany's Bundesbank is highly likely to lower its main money market interest rate this week, finally following through on a promise made in April to cut the rate when conditions allowed, economists said on Tuesday.They said a marked slowdown in the headline growth rate for M3 money supply in July, combined with low inflation and an uneasy economic upturn, meant that the climate was now right for a cut of up to 10-20 basis points in the repo rate.In a Reuter poll of 10 economists, eight believed a small cut in the 3.30 percent rate was on the cards when the central bank council meets on Thursday after a four-week summer break."An interest rate cut is appropriate. The M3 figures were in line with expectations and would not block a repo easing," said Norbert Braems, senior economist at BZW in Frankfurt.The Bundesbank said today annualised M3 money supply growth dropped to 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.Inflation has been running at about 1.5 percent for several months and there is no fear of it gaining pace any time soon.Although July's M3 growth was still above a seven percent target ceiling, analysts said the figure was encouraging as it meant the central bank could reach its goal by the year-end.Signs of a slowdown in M3 were a stated condition for the Bundesbank to lower the repo rate, the rate at which central bank funds are made available to German banks.The rate has been held at 3.30 percent since February, even though the central bank lowered official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- to 2.50 and 4.50 percent respectively in April.Ulrich Beckmann at DB Research responded warmly to the M3 data. "It was at the lower end of our expectation, which was 8.6 to 9.1 percent," he said."It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate," he added.Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, agreed. "Monetary expansion has slowed considerably. This is a very good sign for the Bundesbank on Thursday. I expect a repo rate cut of 10 to 20 basis points."But economists said the final decision could depend on consumer confidence data from the respected Ifo institute, due on Wednesday. Economists expect the business climate index to show at best a small improvement in July."M3 will help to argue for cut. But tomorrow's Ifo figures will be more influential as far as a repo cut is concerned," said Ros Lifton at Daiwa Europe in London.Analysts expect the index to climb slightly to around 91.0, after hitting a three-month low at 90.4 in June.Although the Bundesbank does not follow an anti-cyclical policy -- lowering rates at any sign of economic weakness -- the current low-inflation environment leaves the Bundesbank fairly free to use its policy to help the economic recovery.It often refers to Ifo data in its reports."The Bundesbank will not have any better arguments for easing rates in future than on Thursday," said Norbert Meissner at Caisse des Depots et Consignations in Frankfurt."The inflationary environment is good and if the Bundesbank wants to help the economy it had better act now."But a minority of economists, possibly wary that the central bank appeared four weeks ago to prepare markets for a repo cut, but then failed to deliver the goods, said they had now given up expecting a further easing at all this cycle.Armin Kayser at SBC Warburg said he was also extremely sceptical there would be any economic impact from such a move."A cut by a few basis points will not stimulate the economy and it may be that the economy doesn't even need it," he said.

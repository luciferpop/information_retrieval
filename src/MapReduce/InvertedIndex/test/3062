UK: New computer-delivered anaesthesia goes on market.New computer-delivered anaesthesia goes on market.A computer-controlled system for delivering anaesthesia, which developers claim reduces post-operative nausea to almost nil, will go on sale commercially in Britain next month.The Target Controlled Infusion system will be marketed at first by Zeneca Group Plc, a spokeswoman for the developers at Glasgow University and HCI International Medical Centre in Clydebank, Scotland, said.The system, introduced at the World Congress of Anaesthesia in Sydney in April, uses a computer microchip to calculate tiny, exact doses of drug."It is the only commercially available system designed to deliver this type of intravenous anaesthesia in the world, providing for the first time ever a safe and accurate way of administering non-emetic (not causing nausea) anaesthetic drugs," the hospital said in a statement.The system's developer, anaesthesiologist Gavin Kenny, said it bypassed having to deliver drugs through a respirator."It enables us to use an intravenous agent, Diprivan, not only to make the patient go to sleep but also to maintain anesthesia," Kenny said."The patient wakes up very clear-headed but with no nausea," he added. "No nausea, no vomiting, no nasty taste in the mouth."He said that of the 40,000 to 50,000 patients who had been given the drug this way, not one had died of complications arising from anaesthesia.The device costs about the same as conventional anaesthetic equipment -- about 1,500 pounds ($2,300) -- and would be commercially available from September 3, Kenny said. ($1=.6471 Pound)

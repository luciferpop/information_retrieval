FRANCE: Pechiney may cut 3-3,500 jobs - unions.Pechiney may cut 3-3,500 jobs - unions.French aluminium and packaging group Pechiney may cut between 3,000 and 3,500 jobs by end 1998 under its cost reduction plan code-named Challenge, trade union sources said on Tuesday.The plan, which is aimed at cutting costs by between 1.5 and three billion francs by 1998 should be announced next month.But a company spokeswoman said it would be premature to quote a job reduction figure.The company has already said there would be no layoffs in France. Pechiney will hold a board meeting on September 19 ahead of the release of its first half earnings.Company offficials said Pechiney may also hold a meeting of its group committee the same day to fine tune its estimate of the cost savings the Challenge plan will generate.Pechiney employs 37,000 people worldwide, of which 19,000 are in France.Pechiney swung back to profit in 1995 but wants to raise profitability to the level of its best competitors in all businesses. It sees cost savings as a way to meet investment needs without furher raising debt.In a June interview with French business weekly Investir Pechniney chairman Jean-Pierre Rodier said profit in 1996 would probably remain unchanged from the previous year because while macroeconomic factors looked good it was still unclear when this would help sales volume.Pechiney had a net profit of 1.47 billion francs in 1995 but this included 730 million francs of capital gains linked to the sale of assets.-- Dominique Vidalon, Pais newsroom +331 4221 5432

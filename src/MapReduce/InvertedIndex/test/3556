TAIWAN: Taiwan vice-president receives degree in Ukraine.Taiwan vice-president receives degree in Ukraine.A Taiwan television station on Tuesday showed film of Vice-President Lien Chan at a university in Ukraine, ending a two-day mystery over his whereabouts.The videotape showed Lien, his wife and other Taiwan and Ukraine officials posing outside of the University of Kiev, where the announcer said Lien had received an honorary degree.  State-funded Taiwan Television said Lien's visit was arranged by the university, indicating it was unofficial, but said Lien had met Ukrainian officials and was awaiting a meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.None of the officials who Lien met was identified by name.A former Soviet republic, Ukraine recognises the Chinese communist government in Beijing, not Taiwan's exiled Republic of China, but has made clear its desire for better ties with Taiwan and its powerful export-driven economy.China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province not entitled to foreign relations, has sternly criticised countries that have entertained visits by Lien and other Taiwan leaders.

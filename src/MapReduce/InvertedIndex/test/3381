VENEZUELA: Venezuelan inflation sends results topsy-turvy.Venezuelan inflation sends results topsy-turvy.As if to foil recent foreign interest in Caracas stocks, Venezuelan corporate results are suffering a bout of inflation-adjusted accounting -- and its effects have sent company results through Alice's looking-glass.What does it mean, for example, when a near-bankrupt company suddenly reports a forty-six fold increase in profits?"You stop looking at earnings," said InvestAnalysis consultant Alex Dalmady who advises stock market analysts to leave their number-crunching and financial ratios to one side, at least for the moment.  "Don't forget, Rembrandt, Picasso and Van Gogh didn't create their masterpieces by painting by numbers," Dalmady cautioned in a recent market commentary.Accountants bounce the numbers, writing-up and writing-down. Debt-holders report bulging profits: the past 12 months of 100 percent inflation reduces the real value of debt, allowing a "monetary gain" to pass from the balance sheet to the profit and loss statement.The opposite is true for cash rich companies that are penalized as that same inflation eats into the real value of their cash.  "There's no really good way to view the stats," said Frank Amador of CNI financial consultants who notes that inflation- adjusted accounting has its uses when inflation, interest rates and foreign exchange rates are moving in the same direction.But over the past year in Venezuela the three components uncoupled as real interest rates turned negative while inflation soared and currency controls left the exchange rate fixed.IMF-inspired economic reforms launched mid-April have since brought a degree of rationality to the economy. But residual macroeconomic static still sends company results in a thousand different directions.  "Until inflation comes down, the numbers are going to remain fairly unenlightening," said a New York-based investor. Monthly inflation is decelerating, but still running at a five percent monthly clip.Troubled paints company Corimon, suspended from the New York and Caracas stock exchange earlier this year, reported a year end loss of 60 billion bolivars in mid-July. Two weeks later, however, it reported first quarter profits of 12 million bolivars.  "The inflation and devaluation that impacted so negatively at the close of our fiscal year... have now produced favorable results," explained the company in a press release.Meanwhile, market-leading stock Electricidad de Caracas -- currently locked in battle with the Ministry of Energy and Mines over delayed increases in electricity rates -- posted a non-adjusted one billion bolivar first half loss at the beginning of August.Later in the same day, however, it reported an inflation- adjusted 17 billion bolivar first half profit.  "It does look strange," admitted an Electricidad spokesperson. "But we do have a serious cash flow problem," she added, noting that the company made an inflation-adjusted ten billion bolivar operating loss.And if company results are not what they seem, that's doubly true for Banks, analysts say. "Their recent results have had little to do with core businesses," said Dalmady.Most notably, profits have bulged among those that went long on dollars before the bolivar was devalued forty percent on April 22.Two state-owned banks, Consolidado and Venezuela, both slated for re-privatization before the end of the year, owed 93 percent and 68 percent of their profits to extraordinary exchange gains, according to Dalmady.The majority of remaining profits have derived from investments in Central Bank paper, called TEMs, rather than lending or project finance."I think there'll be some very surprised investors when monthly inflation falls to one or two percent," said Dalmady who currently favors only one benchmark ratios, price to sales, as an indicator of a business's market capitalization compared to its size."When the dust settles you're going to hear people exclaim: My God, that company's making money! And of course the flipside: that one's losing!"-- Caracas newsroom, 582 834405

NIGERIA: Nigeria calls reports of Ogoni arrests "crazy".Nigeria calls reports of Ogoni arrests "crazy".Nigerian authorities on Tuesday described as "crazy" reports that 16 activists from the Ogoni region had been arrested."It is crazy to say Ogonis have been arrested for being MOSOP (Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People) members, any time an Ogoni is arrested for anything they have to say it is political. I am not aware of these arrests at all," Fidelis Agbiki, press secretary to the local military administrator told Reuters by telephone from Port Harcourt.MOSOP on Monday said a total of sixteen Ogoni activists had been arrested in the past month."Less than three weeks before the scheduled visit of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to Nigeria, a new wave of arrests of MOSOP activists has begun," the group said in a statement issued in London.Nigeria became an international pariah after MOSOP leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists were executed for murder last November, provoking international protests and Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth.MOSOP said that the first of the new wave of arrests was Akina Deesor, producer of a radio station in Ogoni. Deesor was detained on July 31 for broadcasting an Ogoni song.Fifteen more people were arrested on August 13 and accused of planning to seek meetings with the Commonwealth mission, it added."Victims of the latest arrests are detained at unknown destinations and MOSOP believes they must have been tortured and kept in terrible conditions," the statement said.Earlier this year, Nigeria refused to allow a Commonwealth fact-finding mission into the country, allowing instead a team from the United Nations.However, Nigeria has now agreed to allow a Commonwealth visit, which is expected next month, although no date has yet been officially announced."We are not guilty of 'Ogoniphobia'," said Agbiki. "As we don't even know if the Commonwealth will visit here how can we arrest people for trying to meet them?"The U.N. team called for reform of some laws but backed a plan for restoring democracy by 1988, which the Commonwealth group had called "inadequate"."The visit of the UN fact-finding team to Nigeria last April occasioned similar repression in Ogoni and the reprisal actions that followed that visit cost the Ogonis two lives and several detentions," MOSOP said.The 500,000 Ogonis live on oil-rich land, which MOSOP says has been ruined by the activities of producing companies.Shell, the largest multinational oil company in Nigeria halted production there in 1993 after acts of sabotage by Ogonis.

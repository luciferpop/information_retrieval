ARGENTINA: Argentine government sends measures to Congress.Argentine government sends measures to Congress.The Argentine government will send its latest package of economic measures to Congress on Tuesday, said President Carlos Menem's Chief of Staff Alberto Kohan.The measures are aimed at addressing the budget deficit, which was $2.5 billion by mid-year, by raising revenue through tax increases, mainly on fuel. Although the government is hoping the measures will be passed as soon as possible, Oscar Lamberto, chairman of the Budget and Finance Commission of the lower house of Congress, said they would not become law until end-September or early October.  "Although we are dedicating all our time to this, it will be difficult for deputies to be discussing this before two or three weeks' time," said Lamberto.Some analysts fear the measures, with which Economy Minister Roque Fernandez hopes to save $1.2 billion this year and narrow a budget deficit, which he warns could otherwise reach of $6.6 billion, could be watered down by lawmakers.But Kohan told reporters the executive expected Congress to approve all "the necessary laws to accompany firm action by government."With the spotlight on government action against the budget deficit, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund was due to arrive in Argentina today.Argentina overshot the budget deficit target agreed with the IMF for the first half of this year by more than $1.0 billion. Despite the overshoot, the IMF has welcomed the government's tax raising measures, saying they show Argentina's determination in belt-tightening.-- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, +541 318-0668

CANADA: Slight frost risk for Canadian grain next two days.Slight frost risk for Canadian grain next two days.There is a slight risk of frost damage to Canadian grain in the foothills of Alberta on Wednesday morning and along the Saskatchewan/Manitoba border on Thursday, an Environment Canada meteorologist said.Brian Bukosi, of Environment Canada, said the outlook had become drier and cooler for Manitoba and Saskatchewan since Monday's forecasts, when only a slight risk of frost in Alberta was anticipated."There is a clear dry area and temperatures (at chest level) may be as low of 4.0 to 5.0 (Centigrade) so there is a slight risk of pockets of frost (in Manitoba/Saskatchewan)," he said.Temperatures at chest level are normally around four degrees higher than at ground level, Bukosi said.The longer term outlook saw no other risk of frost in key grain growing areas up to Thursday August 29.--Nigel Hunt 312-408 8720

USA: USWC crude up with WTI, diffs flat with deal seen.USWC crude up with WTI, diffs flat with deal seen.U.S. West Coast light crude prices continued rising with cash West Texas Intermediate, while differentials coasted at last week's levels amid razor-thin business late Monday.Activity ground to a near halt as traders left for a industry golf game.Players heard talk that a major West Coast refiner bought a cargo of Alaska North Slope (ANS) early from the ANS's main seller.The cargo reportedly sold for $1.95 off September WTI, the level of the last deal, done August 14.  Northwest refiners said they were waiting for the results of Monday's pipe line nominations on the Inter Provincial Pipe Line (IPL) in Canada's midwest.Surplus from the line could move west, offsetting their need to buy ANS, traders said."It depends on (the grade's) price," one refinery trader said, adding his basic needs were filled, but he might need extra.Prices for Kern River and Wilmington were notionally flat, as postings were unchanged from mid-July.Prices for Line 63 tracked higher WTI values, with traders reporting no new deals.Pre-nominations for Line 63 shipments will begin Tuesday traders said, with little change from last month's restrictions.-- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau +1 213 380 2014

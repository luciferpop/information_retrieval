In the former Soviet Union, production declined by two percent to 6.5 million tonnes."However, the production decline in Russia in July was considerably less dramatic than in earlier months at 4.1 million tonnes, it was down by only 1.3 percent from July 1995 production," IISI said.In North America, output rose four percent to 10.2 million tonnes, "confirming the region's growth trend," IISI said.In the United States, output jumped five percent year-on-year to 7.9 million tonnes. "Best U.S. steel industry customers in July were the automotive and construction sectors," it said.Output in Africa fell by three percent to 1.1 million tonnes while it soared 14.4 percent to 705,000 tonnes in the Middle East and rose by 1.2 percent in Asia to 22.4 million tonnes. Continued growth was registered in China, up 7.2 percent to 8.2 million tonnes compared with the same month last year.

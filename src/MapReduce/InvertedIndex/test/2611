GERMANY: German shares steady, M3 fails to provide push.German shares steady, M3 fails to provide push.Germany's blue-chip DAX index opened stable on Tuesday, supported by money supply data viewed as boosting the case for an interest rate cut this week.The 30-share DAX was up 1.53 points at 2,564.29 points at 0849 GMT and was expected to hold steady around that level through the day, with order volumes relatively thin."We are not opening up any big positions," a Frankfurt trader said.The market got an early boost when July M3 money supply data, released early in the morning, showed a slowdown in the monthly growth to 8.6 percent from 9.6 percent -- a figure which could support the case for a cut this week in the securities repurchase rate, or repo.However the data failed to generate new momentum in the share market and dealers noted that a repo rate cut was generally already priced in."What we really need is a dollar above 1.50 (marks) to give us a new impulse," said another dealer.Blue chip stocks were mixed, with utility stocks the clear winners of the day while chemicals faded from popularity.Dealers said investors were shifting into utilities from the chemicals sector.Diversified utility Viag AG, which is expected to release six-month earnings on Tuesday, was up 3.20 marks at 568 marks and RWE AG was up 85 pfennigs at 55.35.Meanwhile Bayer AG was down 67 pfennigs at 52.05 marks and BASF AG was down 25 pfennigs at 42.70 marks.

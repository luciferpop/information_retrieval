TAIWAN: Taiwan stocks end up on China shipping hopes.Taiwan stocks end up on China shipping hopes.Taiwan share prices rebounded from an early slide on Tuesday to close slightly higher on news that China had issued rules governing direct shipping links with estranged Taiwan, brokers said.China's official Xinhua news agency said the regulations were effective immediately, although Taipei still bans direct shipping links across the Taiwan strait.The index ended up 9.93 points or 0.16 percent at 6,057.44, off an opening low of 5,988.12. Turnover was a modest T$29.94 billion.  "The news on direct shipping immediately triggered a rebound on China-concept shares, as it should help ease recent tensive Taiwan-China relations," said Alex Yang of National Securities.China-concept shares are those in Taiwan firms with major investments or investment plans in China. Shipping giant Yang Ming Marine and Evergreen Marine rose T$1.1 and 40 cents to T$36 and T$46.5, respectively.Speculation that Taipei might change its China policies has mounted since President Lee Teng-hui cautioned on August 14 that Taiwan needed to avoid over-dependence on China for investment.  After seeing the opening break below psychological support at 6,000, bargain hunters immediately entered, brokers said."A technical rebound after breaking 6,000 was widely expected," said Tank Hung of Yuanta Securities. "Today's bargain hunters were likely foreign funds or government-related funds."Many local institutional investors have sold heavily on recent Taiwan-China tensions. Foreign institutions have not."Foreign institutions in general are not pessimistic on Taiwan's stock market prospects," said Ben Lee of Nomura Securities.  "Foreign funds intend to establish their portfolios before Morgan Stanley starts to include Taiwan into its global indices in September," Lee said.Brokers expected the index to consolidate in the near term as Taiwan-China tensions linger after President Lee's comment and Vice-President Lien Chan's secret journey to an unidentified country -- which is expected to anger China.For Wednesday, a 6,020-6,100 range was seen.-- James Peng (5080815)

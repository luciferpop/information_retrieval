RUSSIA: Security Council doubts if Yeltsin orders genuine.Security Council doubts if Yeltsin orders genuine.The Russian Security Council said on Tuesday that it doubted the authenticity of President Bolris Yeltsin's latest orders on Chechnya."The contents of the documents gives solid ground to doubt that the president of Russia took a direct part in finalising the text of the order," said a statement by the policy-making Security Council, of which new security chief Alexander Lebed is the secretary.Yeltsin on Sunday ordered Lebed, whom he had put in charge of handling the 20-monthold conflict in Chechnya, to regain Russian control over the capital Grozny from rebels who seized large parts of it on August 6.The Security Council statement said an attempt to carry out this order would ruin peace efforts undertaken by Lebed and wreck a ceasefire deal he agreed with the separatist leaders.The statement said Yeltsin's orders were issued with a facsimile of the president's signature rather than signed by the president in person. It has also said Lebed was not aware of the preparation of the orders -- which violated normal rules.The Russian military commander in the Chechen capital Grozny on Monday gave the rebels 48 hours to leave the city or face an all-out bombardment.

Traders said expectations of a build in U.S. inventories when the American Petroleum Institute (API) reports later on Tuesday were adding to the pressure on crude and products.Low stocks, particularly of heating oil, have helped fuel the recent rally across the complex.Traders and analysts surveyed by Reuters expected middle distillate stocks -- mainly heating oil and diesel -- to have risen by just over one million barrels last week."The market was fairly quiet this afternoon. People were waiting for September to expire and the API figures before resuming normal business tomorrow," said a broker.  Earlier, prompt IPE gas oil futures closed narrowly lower after a quiet session with most activity concentrated on the Sep/Oct spread, dealers said.September gas oil settled at $188.25 a tonne, down 25 cents but towards the middle of the session's range of $186.50-$189.00 a tonne.The prompt intermonth spread shed 75 cents a tonne to stand at $1.25.-- Mark Thompson, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7930

UK: UKRAINE OIL EXPORTS TO GREECE SEEN IN 1997.UKRAINE OIL EXPORTS TO GREECE SEEN IN 1997.Ukraine will begin crude oil exports to Greece in early 1997 as production from a promising development in the Crimea increases nearly tenfold from current levels, one of the developers said.Ronald Cormick, president of Canadian independent oil and gas company Epic Energy Inc, said production from the company's Aktash field should rise from the current 800 barrels per day to 7,000 bpd in the first quarter 1997.He said the company had secured about 4 million in financing needed to undertake the drilling programme. Epic and its joint venture partner KyrmTexasNafta Ltd would drill 40-60 wells from now until early January once financing is in place."If we have no weather problems, we'll get it done in January. If not, we'll be there by March," Cormick said.Cormick said the Aktash partners have already been in contact with Greek refiners interested in buying the oil not sold to the local Lviv refinery. He said the oil would be sold to the Greeks through a long-term contract rather than on a spot basis."I want to establish the export process as it gives you a greater control of your destiny. The gas will all be used internally but about 80 percent of the liquids will be exported," Cormick said.Aktash oil has an API gravity of between 23 and 25 degrees with no paraffinic or sulphur content, Cormick said.    -- Karen Matusic, London newsroom +44 171 542 6280

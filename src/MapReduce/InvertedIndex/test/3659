USA: USDA meteorologist says normal frost threat small.USDA meteorologist says normal frost threat small.U.S. Agriculture Department chief meteorologist Al Peterlin said given current crop conditions, a very small percentage of the U.S. crop would be vulnerable to damage from a normal frost."I don't see it being the overpowering consideration at this particular moment," Peterlin told USDA radio."If you look in Iowa, based on current conditions if we had a normal frost there's really just about five percent of the crop that would be subject to some kind of damage," he said.  Peterlin said up to 10 percent of the crop in Indiana would be vulnerable to some kind of damage with a normal frost date and estimated up to 10 to 15 percent of the crop in Ohio would be at risk.As for concerns about an early frost, Peterlin said a cold season is not a good predictor of an early frost and said in fact it may be the opposite."We could have a cool season because we have extensive cloud cover which ends up moderating that extreme dip in temperatures. What I would look at is the severity of the cool air outbreaks as they start coming out of Canada," he said."This is still August, we have, even with cool temperatures, an awful lot of 80 plus degree days ahead of us, a chance to get this crop growing," the USDA meteorologist said."There is no question it's a problem. We have some vulnerability and we want to continue to watch it and be cognizent of what's going on but until I can actually forecast a frost date I'm just not yet ready to panic," Peterlin said.

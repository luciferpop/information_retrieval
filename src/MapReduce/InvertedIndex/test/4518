NEW ZEALAND: Bradford has reservations on NZ Forest Corp sale.Bradford has reservations on NZ Forest Corp sale.Prominent government backbencher Max Bradford said on Tuesday he had significant reservations about the sale of Forestry Corporation to a consortium led by Fletcher Challenge Ltd.Bradford is the ruling National Party's candidate for the seat of Rotorua and has questioned the wisdom of a sale to the Fletcher consortium after reports that it may scale down the Waipa sawmill situated in his electorate.Bradford said a major positive of the deal announced on Tuesday was the commitment by the consortium not to close the Waipa mill and to invest NZ$16 million in an upgrade.  "The Prime Minister (Jim Bolger) and Finance Minister (Bill Birch) have given me a commitment they will ensure the FCL joint venture will live up to its commitment," Bradford said."Therefore, the workforce should have no concern about their jobs.""I would have to say Fletchers' poor public relations image means they start behind the eight-ball," Bradford said.He said he "would not be honest...if he did not admit to some significant reservations about the sale to Fletchers".  "Nor can I say all my concerns, particularly with respect to the development of the best long-term strategy for forestry in New Zealand and a healthy investment programme which leads to jobs and higher incomes with this bid have been satisfied by ministers."He said Fletcher Forests chief executive Michael Andrews had agreed to put the company's plans to the local communities in a few days.-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

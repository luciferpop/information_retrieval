ISRAEL: Israel successfully test fires anti-missile missile.Israel successfully test fires anti-missile missile.Israel successfully test fired a U.S.-financed Arrow 2 anti-missile missile over the Mediterranean on Tuesday, officials said.They said the Arrow 2, launched from the coastline in central Israel, apparently hit its target which was fired four minutes earlier at about 3 p.m. (12 GMT) from a ship."Initial data indicates that the missile performed as planned," a Defence Ministry statement said."The results indicate that the Arrow's sensors locked in on the target, its warhead was activated and the target was hit."It was "a big success" said Moshe Keret, director-general of Israel Aircraft Industries in charge of the project. Keret said official confirmation as to whether the target was actually destroyed would take a few hours.Tuesday's flight was the third of the Arrow 2 but the first intercepting a missile. Keret said additional test launches would be carried out.Asked if the launch would allay Israeli fears after reports that Syria had recently test fired an advanced Scud-C missile capable of hitting Israeli cities, Keret told Israel army radio:"Maybe not in the immediate future but when the system will be operational, maybe in about two years, that will certainly be an important and central layer in the defence system of the state of Israel."Tension has been rising between Israel and Syria over stalled Middle East peace talks since the May election of Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu.Development of the Arrow was launched in the late 1980s and U.S. funding was approved as part of the Strategic Defence Intitiative, known as Star Wars.Most components of that initiative have since been scrapped but the 1991 Gulf War, in which Iraq fired dozens of Scud missiles at Israel, gave the Arrow new impetus with the United States ploughing nearly $500 million for initial development.The project cost is estimated at $1.2 billion.Israel spent several years developing and testing the Arrow 1 which it hoped would do a better job at hitting incoming missiles than the U.S. Patriot missiles, with a range of 10 km (six miles), deployed in Israel during the Gulf War.The target missile used in Tuesday's test-launch was a modified Arrow 1 missile with a radar cross section and payload to match that of a Scud missile, said the U.S. Army Program Executive Office Air and Missile Defence in a statement."The Arrow program is a joint U.S./Israel effort to develop an interceptor missile for the Arrow Weapons System. The information gained from the program has potential application for several U.S. missile defence programs," the statement said.

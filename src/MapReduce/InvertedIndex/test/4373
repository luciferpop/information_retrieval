SPAIN: Bono-Bund spread seen wider if Buba fails to cut.Bono-Bund spread seen wider if Buba fails to cut.Whatever the U.S. Federal Reserve and the German Bundesbank decide to do with their key money rates this week, the damage for Spanish markets would at worst be a widening of the Bono-Bund yield spread to about 270 basis points from 264 now, analysts said."If the Buba doesn't cut, the bond spread should widen to around 265-270 basis points, and if it does the gap should narrow to 255-260," said Alfredo Urrutia, chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.Views are mixed on the possibility of a cut in the German repo rate from 3.30 percent now, although those expecting a move predict a trim of around 10 basis points.No change in the German central bank's key money rate would mean a return to recent bond market lows, but the risk of a sustained sell-off is limited, analysts agreed."If the Buba doesn't cut on August 22 it will be negative for the markets, but not as much as if it doesn't move again on September 5," said Jose Maria Castellon, analyst at Merrill Lynch.If the Bundesbank leaves the repo steady, the markets will continue to expect a cut next month, analysts said. But this still implied an initial negative impact on the dollar and peripheral European currencies after Thursday's meeting."Initially we would move back to minimum (bono) levels and the mark would once again be the stronger currency," Alfredo Urrutia said."The peseta will be nearer to 85 per mark than 84.50 if the Buba leaves rates" he added.German M3 data for July, which was at the lower end of economists' forecasts, have reinforced expectations of a cut in the repo rate.Castellon said the market has already priced in a small cut."For that reason I don't think it would affect the peseta much," he said.Analysts have their doubts about German rates but are more certain that key U.S. money rates will stay on hold.An eventual hike in rates on the other side of the Atlantic would prompt market volatility at first, they said.A stronger dollar following a U.S. rate hike might help the peseta, but simultaneous Treasury and stock market losses could see parallel movements in Spain. This may serve to weaken the peseta against the mark.-- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160

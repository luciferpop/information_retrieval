RUSSIA: Russian MinFins correct down, Yeltsin not worrisome.Russian MinFins correct down, Yeltsin not worrisome.Prices of Russian MinFin bonds eased on Tuesday in a correction after last week's rise and dealers said uncertainty about President Boris Yeltsin's health had little impact on the market.The Russian Security Council of top officials, whose secretary is Alexander Lebed, issued a statement casting doubt on the authenticity of Yeltsin's recent orders on Chechnya, where fighters want independence from Russia.The presidential press service said the Kremlin leader had started a two-day break in northwestern Russia.		 tranche  Aug 20		  Aug 19 1999 maturity (3)    76.15-76.45	   76.35-76.65 2003 maturity (4)    49.30-49.60	   49.90-50.20 2008 maturity (5)    32.35-33.65	   32.90-33.20 2006 maturity (6)    37.80-38.10	   38.10-38.40 2011 maturity (7)    28.40-28.70	   28.60-28.90"The market is not especially concerned about Yeltsin's health. The fall is not rapid. It is just a correction after the rise as the market, known to be volatile, cannot grow two points every day," Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said."There is no negative news around. Everybody is still awaiting (Russia's) Eurobonds, and there should be a confirmation the International Monetary Fund is giving its July tranche of the ($10 billion) loan," he added.Other dealers said some buying interest was still evident on the market, mainly from abroad."The market is going both ways. Russian banks are generally selling, with foreigners buying immediately, but then prices are going down without trading," a Russian bank dealer said."Some impact of Yeltsin news is possible as prices were too high (after last week's rise)," he added.Dealers said the MinFin bond market was showing little concern about the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which began at 1300 GMT."Russian operators are not looking straight at the meeting, those in the West may do," the Russian bank dealer said.Coursault said most of the market was not concerned about the FOMC meeting, and traders did not believe interest rates would be raised.--Artyom Danielyan, Moscow newsroom (095) 941 8520

PHILIPPINES: Agriculture seen boosting Philippine Q2 GNP.Agriculture seen boosting Philippine Q2 GNP.Philippine gross national product (GNP) growth in the second quarter of 1996 is likely to exceed the 6.24 percent registered in the first quarter, a senior government official said on Tuesday."We won't be surprised if it's higher than first quarter because of the strong agriculture sector," Dante Canlas, deputy director general of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), told Reuters.  Canlas, who declined to give figures, said second quarter growth was normally lower than the first quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in the agriculture sector.He added that the improvement in agriculture this year would more than offset the impact of the export sector, which had not been performing as well as expected.NEDA is expected to release the second quarter growth figures around the end of August.The Philippine government says it expects full-year GNP growth of 6.5 to 7.5 percent against 5.7 percent in 1995.Canlas is in the southern Philippine city of Davao attending a meeting of senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.-Manila newsroom 632 8418938 Fax 8176267.

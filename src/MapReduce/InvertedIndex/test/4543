AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian senator quits Labor opposition.RTRS-Australian senator quits Labor opposition.A member of Australia's Labor Party opposition said he quit the party on Tuesday in a move that could affect government efforts to pass legislation through parliament's upper house, the Senate.Mal Colston, a Labor senator, said his resignation took effect immediately.  "It is my intention to complete my present term in the Senate as an independent," Colston said in a statement."My voting pattern in that chamber will be influenced by my long held Labor beliefs, by an acceptance that the present government has an electoral mandate to pursue a number of issues and by what I judge to be the most appropriate course of action for the people of Queensland (state)," he said.Colston would not comment further. His resignation from the Labor Party means he is now no longer bound by party policy and can decide his own position on legislation.  The new conservative Liberal-National government elected in March does not have a majority in the Senate and needs support of at least two non-government senators to pass legislation.Prime Minister John Howard, pointing to his landslide election win, has claimed a strong mandate from the electorate for several controversial moves, including selling one-third of government telecoms giant Telstra Corp.The Labor opposition and minor parties holding the Senate balance of power have pleged to block some of the government reforms, including the partial Telstra privatisation.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

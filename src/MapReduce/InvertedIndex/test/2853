USA: FORECAST - Experts see Fed tightening in November.FORECAST - Experts see Fed tightening in November.With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at its August policy meeting, U.S. economists now expect no rate change until after the November 5th Presidential election, according to the most recent Reuters poll.Only three of 29 economists surveyed on Tuesday called for a move at the upcoming September 24 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Both said the move would be a tightening.  A majority of the experts -- 16 of 29 -- forecast a tightening at the November 13 meeting in response to signs of increased inflation."We'll see a slight tightening after the election," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp.The central bank may see signs of increased wage inflation in upcoming economic reports, but none drastic enough for a rate hike at the next meeting, Hoffman said.He is expecting a gain of 200,000 new jobs in the August employment report, the next key data for monetary policymakers.  But the report "would have to be a lot stronger than that" to push the Fed into a September tightening, according to Hoffman.Michael Casey, international economist at MFR Inc, said the Federal Reserve would look closely at the manufacturing sector in the coming weeks."It's very vapory at this point," Casey said. "If they saw something a little more solid there I think it would prompt them."  Nineteen economists forecast the Fed's next move would be a tightening. Five said the central bank was on hold for the foreseeable future. And two said they expect an interest rate cut.Two of the experts called for a change in rates in 1997 but did not specify whether interest rates would be raised or lowered.The current survey differed slightly from a poll conducted last Friday which had 12 of 30 economists predicting a November tightening.Full results of the survey follow.

UK: CRICKET-COUNTIES REJECT MOVE TO GIVE SELECTORS GREATER CONTROL.CRICKET-COUNTIES REJECT MOVE TO GIVE SELECTORS GREATER CONTROL.County cricket clubs on Tuesday rejected a move to give England selectors greater control over their international players.A clause in the recent Acfield Report recommended that the selection committee chairman should be able to withdraw England players from county matches in order to rest top talent.But on Tuesday that was the only one of the 14 Acfield clauses to be thrown out at a Test and County Cricket Board meeting at Lords, although the board hierarchy was assured requests to rest a player would receive "a sympathetic ear."The seven-man Acfield committee put forward in-depth proposals earlier this year for streamlining the selection of English teams.TCCB chief executive Tim Lamb said: "The Acfield working party will be disappointed, but deep down in their heart of hearts they probably knew it would not get agreement."Tuesday's meeting also rejected a move to have overseas players banned from English cricket in 1999 and 2000 on a trial basis and decided that in future all test matches will include Sunday play, with no rest day.

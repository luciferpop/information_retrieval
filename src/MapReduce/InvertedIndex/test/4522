AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Path seen clear for silver to trade higher.RTRS-Path seen clear for silver to trade higher.Silver prices have turned a corner after breaching technical resistance levels and are now poised for further gains, Australian metals dealers said on Tuesday.COMEX silver ended up 13.300 U.S. cents an ounce at $5.210, after trading up to a session high at $5.240.Technical resistance markers surrounding a price of $5.15 an ounce had been keeping a cap on the price."We think silver could trade up to around $5.40 (an ounce) over the next couple of months," Ross Ryan, a dealer for Macquarie Bank said.  End users of silver, such as photographic film manufacturers and jewellery fabricators are said to be willing buyers of silver under $5.00 an ounce, but may now re-think their buying strategies in light of the price run-up."It all depends on whether silver keeps going up and the price is sustainable," another dealer said.Silver has been stuck in a $5.00-$5.18 range for a couple of months and was long-due for a price move outside the range, the dealer said.  Australia's MIM Holdings Ltd, which produced 12.6 million ounces of silver in 1995/96, making it one of the world's largest silver miners, would see about A$5 million added to its bottom line for each 10 percent gain in the price on an annual basis, a company spokesman told Reuters.The Perth Mint on Tuesday quoted silver at US$5.23 an ounce (A$6.61).-- James Regan Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

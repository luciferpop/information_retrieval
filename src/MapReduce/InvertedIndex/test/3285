SLOVAKIA: Slovak money rates seen easing toward 10 pct.Slovak money rates seen easing toward 10 pct.Slovak short-term money market rates were seen easing toward 10 percent from current 12-13.2 percent, potentially taking the shine off crown securities and deposits, dealers said."The (stronger) crown boosted the central bank foreign exchange reserves, and eventually market liquidity. High deposit rates are unjustified and we expect their decline," said Dalibor Cernicka, a Istrobanka dealer.Added Robert Hakszer, a head of dealing at Slovenska Sporitelna: "In the longer-term, rates could slowly ease to 10-12 percent, spoiling some of the crown's attraction."Slovak interbank money market rates eased to a bid range of 12.0-13.2 percent on Tuesday amid a liquidity surplus, with the market eyeing the results of a state bond auction, as well as a possible central bank repo rate cut.In July, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) boosted the interbank interest rates to about 14 percent, in a move to curtail banks short-term lending.The NBS liquidity bill repurchase (repo) and reverse repo rates, which, since then, are the key price determining factor on the market, now stand at 8.2 and 7.4 percent respectively."Both the repo and reverse repo rate could ease slightly even if the state bond auction on Tuesday is successful," Hakszer said.-- Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-210-3687

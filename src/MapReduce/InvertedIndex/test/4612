THAILAND: Thai politician expresses himself with gifts.Thai politician expresses himself with gifts.Thaksin Shinawatra, the tycoon-turned-politician leader of the Palang Dharma Party which recently pulled out of the coalition government, is showering his former colleagues with expensive gifts.Thaksin, who made a fortune in telecommunications and computers before turning to politics, is known for lavishing his friends and colleagues with expensive presents.Last week, Thaksin said he sent a 145,800 baht ($5,832) bottle of Romanee-Conti wine to Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa after pulling the Palang Dharma out of Banharn's 13-month-old coalition government.He said he sent the wine to apologise for leaving the government, which is now facing a no-confidence debate.On Tuesday, deputy prime minister Somboon Rahong surprised bystanders when he drove up to government house in a brand new black Daimler car."It is a present given to me by Thaksin," Somboon, a member of Banharn's Chart Thai party, told reporters."He just said that he liked me, then gave me this. It is not appropriate for me to turn down a present given to me by a millionaire," he said, adding that he did not know the price of the present but estimated it was worth about six million baht.($1 = 25 baht)

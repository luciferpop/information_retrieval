AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Australian Democrats uncertain on budget view.RTRS - Australian Democrats uncertain on budget view.Australian Democrats Leader Cheryl Kernot said on Tuesday it was too early to say if her party could pass all the measures included in the conservative government's 1996/97 budget released earlier on Tuesday.Asked if it was a budget the Democrats could pass, Kernot told Radio 2UE: "I don't think I can answer that tonight".The Liberal-National coalition government needs the support of the Democrats, independents or other minor parties in the upper house, the Senate, to pass its legislation."It's a tough budget.  At first glance, I don't think it's particularly fair", Kernot said.  In a separate statement, Kernot said the Democrats would not block supply bills."We do reserve the right where appropriate, to move amendments requesting that funding be restored, and send them to the House of Representatives for a vote," she said."However, we will not insist on those requests or amendments if the legislation is returned to the Senate because to prevent the passage of appropriate (supply) bills is a recipe for economic chaos."  Kernot said about half the cuts planned by the government could be beyond the Democrats' power to review because of the supply commitment.Treasurer Peter Costello earlier on Tuesday released a budget for the fiscal year to June 30, 1997, cutting spending by A$3.9 billion, for an underlying deficit of A$5.65 billion.The underlying deficit excludes asset sales and state government debt repayments.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

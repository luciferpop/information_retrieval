UK: IBCA affirms Italy l-term foreign AA minus rating.IBCA affirms Italy l-term foreign AA minus rating.IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Tuesday it had affirmed the long-term foreign currency debt rating of Italy at AA minus.  "The rating applies to $92.9 billion of senior and unsecured foreign currency debt obligations of the Republic and sets a ceiling for the foreign currency rating of all Italian entities," IBCA said in a statement.  IBCA also confirmed its rating of A1 plus for short-term foreign currency issues and assigned a long-term local currency rating of AAA to sovereign debt."The small reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio in 1995 - the first since 1980 - signals a possible turning point in Italy's problematic fiscal policy," IBCA said in a statement.  But IBCA said the path would not be easy."A relatively small adverse shift in the macroeconomic environment will be sufficient to blow the government's public debt to gdp projections off course," it said. "IBCA is projecting that the public debt to GDP ratio will rise this year, although it should fall in the more favourable macroeconomic environment expected in 1997.The agency said that significant progress towards the Maastricht criterion of 60 percent was still a long way off.  "Furthermore, despite the mini-budget the inclusion of payments under the Constitutional Court rulings of 1994 means that additional payments will have to be made," IBCA said."Therefore only slight progress will be made this year in reducing the general government deficit. With much of Italy's growth still export-based, the slow-down in its European trading partners means that output growth will be substantially lower in 1996 than was seen in 1995."  Assigning the long-term local currency rating of AAA to Italy sovereign debt, IBCA said this debt was worth 1,547 trillion lire (or $1,020 billion)IBCA said it noted Italy's considerable strengths as a sovereign credit -- "illustrated by the continued dynamism of the private sector, the current account surplus and the high savings ratio.""These aspects of the economy have allowed Italy to sustain high public debt without having to draw on foreign savings," it said.  -- Kate Kelland, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682

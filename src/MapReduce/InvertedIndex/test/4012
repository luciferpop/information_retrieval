Fighting between them began in 1994 and about 3,000 people died in clashes until the ceasefire.The PUK said it had repulsed offensives by the KDP southeast of Arbil and in the remote mountains near the strategic northeastern town of Rawanduz, close to the Iranian border.The two militias, rivals for decades, have accused each other of cooperating with Baghdad or Tehran in the recent fighting and blamed each other for the renewed clashes.

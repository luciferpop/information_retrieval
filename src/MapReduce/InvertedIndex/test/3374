CUBA: Cuban party admits crisis has weakened its support.Cuban party admits crisis has weakened its support.The ruling Communist Party said on Tuesday that Cuba's economic crisis had generated uncertainty, contradictions and increased crime in society and weakened popular support for one-party socialist rule.It was a rare public admission of diminished support by the party, which previously insisted it enjoyed near-unanimous backing among the island's 11 million inhabitants.The party's Central Committee said in a political analysis that economic reforms introduced to counter the recession caused by the collapse of trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc had created social inequalities.This, in turn, has led to "contradictions" such as "a weakening of support for the Revolution in some social groups and persons, above all in those who attribute the cause of the crisis to our mistakes," the party said.Other effects listed in the analysis, published in the official newspaper Granma, included an increase in crimes against state and personal property and the appearance of "entities not committed to state or government action," an apparent reference to emerging private-sector groups.The party said it had noted some Cubans searching "in other societies for the solution to aspirations of wellbeing and consumption" -- that is, wanting to leave the country.In addition, the economic crisis has created "feelings of insecurity, fear, suspicion, confusion, disillusionment, searching for paths of personal salvation, exacerbation of individualism and selfishness," the document said."The majority of the population and Cuban workers do not see a return to capitalism as the solution to our problems." But many Cubans do not fully understand that economic reforms being introduced to beat the crisis need to be gradual, orderly and managed, it said.It said a significant number of Cubans had doubts about the efficiency of socialism in providing goods and services. Others saw the reforms as a "supposed surrender to capitalism and its economic formulas," it said, adding, "This view is not only mistaken but unfair."Cuba's leaders have made clear that only "elements of capitalism" are being introduced, such as management, financing and market techniques, the document said.

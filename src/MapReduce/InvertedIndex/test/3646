USA: World arms sales fall, Russia's rise.World arms sales fall, Russia's rise.World arms sales dropped in 1995 to their lowest level since the Cold War but Russia's rose sharply in its effort to get cash, according to a Congressional Research Service study released on Tuesday.It said arms sales worldwide dropped to $28.8 billion last year from $40 billion after the 1991 Gulf War.But it said Russia's weapons sales rose from $3.8 billion in 1994 to $9.1 billion last year because "now Russia actively seeks to sell weapons as a means of obtaining hard currency."It said Russia's most important customer was China, which has bought Russian S7-27 fighter planes and Kilo class attack submarines since 1994. Iran, which was a major buyer of Russian fighter planes, T-72 tanks and Kilo submarines earlier, had not been a major customer recently because of its own economic problems, the report said.It said the United States was the second-biggest arms seller in 1995 at $8.2 billion, down from $12.8 billion the year before. But it said the United States was the biggest arms seller for the longer periods of 1992-1995 at $69 billion and 1988-1991 at $65.9 billion.The report said France was the third-biggest arms seller last year with $2.7 billion in sales, down from $8.9 billion the year before.It said Britain sold $500 million worth of weapons to developing countries last year compared to $714 million in 1994; Italy $800 million last year, up from $200 million, and Germany $300 million last year from almost none the year before.The Congressional Research Service is in the Library of Congress and does research reports for congressional committees as well as members of Congress.

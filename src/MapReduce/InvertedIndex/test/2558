BELGIUM: Holdings keep a rein on Belgian bourse gain.Holdings keep a rein on Belgian bourse gain.Belgian shares ended Tuesday with modest gains but still lagged other markets.The Bel-20 index had to battle its way through resistance above 1,750. It ended 6.88 points or 0.39 percent higher at 1,760.15, virtually the day's high, with volume a fairly moderate 1.5 billion francs worth of Belgian shares."The market started out quite dull but picked up in the afternoon. It was the holding companies which held us back," one dealer said. Societe Generale De Belgique was unchanged at 2,405 francs and Group Bruxelles Lambert lost 15 francs to 3,980.Dealers could find no key reason for why holdings should have underperformed, citing just a "lack of enthusiasm".Kredietbank was among the most heavily traded stocks in value terms, closing unchanged at 9,350 with 13,686 shares changing hands. "It remains one of the more expensive Belgian banks in terms of price-earnings. You're paying for quality, though it would have to drop 15 to 20 percent before I'd consider it a buy," one dealer said.All eyes were now turned to the U.S. where the Federal Reserve's policy-making FOMC meets on Tuesday, though it is not expected to decide on a change in U.S interest rates.The prospect of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting is providing more suspense, amid growing hopes for a German repo rate cut, dealers said.

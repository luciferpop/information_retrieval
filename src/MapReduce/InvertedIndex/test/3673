USA: U.S. condemns Russian general's threat in Chechnya.U.S. condemns Russian general's threat in Chechnya.The United States on Tuesday condemned a threat by a Russian general to use aircraft and heavy artillery to drive separatist forces from the Chechen capital Grozny, and said force could not solve the problem."We are concerned by General (Konstantin) Pulikovsky's threat ... to use massive force in Grozny," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters."It should be clear to the parties involved that after 20 months of conflict the dispute there cannot be resolved by use of force. There has to be an element of negotiation."Civilians were reported flooding out of Grozny on Tuesday following what Davies called the "frightening threats" by Pulikovsky, Russia's acting commander in Chechnya.Davies said Washington was "sending the same message privately that we're sending publicly" to the Russians."The bottom line is that we urge both of the parties to avoid any actions that will lead to a resumption of full-scale fighting and endanger the fragile dialogue that was begun last week," he said.Russian national security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders agreed last week to arrange a truce to allow peace negotiations to resume.But Pulikovsky, who signed the ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in in the regional capital, much of which they seized two weeks ago.

FINLAND: FINNISH SAK-FAMILY '97 PURCHASE POWER SEEN UP 3%.FINNISH SAK-FAMILY '97 PURCHASE POWER SEEN UP 3%.The purchasing power of Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) families is projected to rise by nearly three percent in 1997, SAK said in a statement on Tuesday."The taxation and payment changes proposed by the government would raise next year the purchasing power of an SAK-family by nearly three percent, or by about 400 markka per month," the 1.1-million mainly blue-collar member union said.  Earlier agreed pay rises due to take effect this autumn and wage drift would raise purchasing power a bit more, but part of the increase would be offset by higher energy taxation, it said."All in all, the family's purchasing power would rise next year by about three percent if the (government's budget) decisions are implemented," SAK said.The calculated increase was based on a model family with two children and both parents at work, one earning 11,241 markka per month before tax, the other 8,920 markka per month before tax.Excluding the impact of the autumn pay rises and of the higher electricity bill, such a family's disposable income after tax, including state child benefits not subject to tax, would increase by some 2.8 percent, or 5,037 markka, to 187,200 markka in 1997, SAK said.--Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245

NEW ZEALAND: Shark cartilage may curb cancer growth - NZ research.Shark cartilage may curb cancer growth - NZ research.Shark cartilage may play a role in curbing blood vessel growth and restricting the spread of cancers, according to new research by New Zealand's Wellington Medical School."We have now established that there is some validity to the claim that shark cartilage can inhibit blood vessel growth," Paul Davis, leader of a research team at the medical school, told Reuters on Tuesday.Blood vessel growth is required for tumours to spread.Sharks have a low incidence of cancer, and ground shark cartilage has for years been used as a folk remedy for tumours, arthritis and other ailments. But there has been little scientific evidence of its effectiveness.Davis said that after a year's work his team had found that in rats fed cartilage from sharks, the development of blood vessels in abnormal tissue was reduced by up to 70 percent."It's an early step but it's a significant one," Davis said. He stressed the research was a long way from showing that shark cartilage was a "cure" for cancer. "But what we would like to think is that it will at least slow the spread."Davis added: "What it's going to do is, rather than putting people on chemotherapies and radiotherapies to try and stop the progression, you may be able to use a compound like this.""If you can at least hold it while you're trying to kill the cancer cells, then the job in theory should be easier," he said.

SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa money market shortage surges 831 mln rand.S.Africa money market shortage surges 831 mln rand.South Africa's money market shortage surged 831 million rand on Monday to 8.847 billion rand, Reserve Bank figures show.Money market traders had varying reasons for the rise, ranging from Reserve Bank manipulation to Standard Bank's repayment of its three billion rand foreign loan which it drew in May."Our view is that the Reserve Bank is trying to keep the shortage at these levels via the tax and loan accounts or by the forex accounts," one trader said."By doing so the Bank keeps short-term rates where they are and keeps the squeeze on (commercial) banks without having to hike Bank rate," he said.But John Cruickshank, Standard Bank domestic treasury director, said that argument was counterproductive."If the (central) Bank keeps the squeeze on the banks then the implication is that rates have to be hiked," he said.Three-month NCDs were static at between 16.65 to 16.85 percent while the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 16.05 and 16.25 percent.Another dealer said the higher shortage was a result of Standard Bank repaying part of the three billion rand offshore loan it drew in May."We believe that in the course of this month, Standard Bank has been repaying part of its offshore loans," the dealer said.Cruickshank had no comment on the speculation.He said that the differing explanations offered for the higher shortage highlighted the fact "that we are all working in a market which is to some extent rather confusing"."The fact that the shortage can gyrate to the extent that it has is disquieting at the best of times," Cruickshank said.-- Paul Richardson, Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003

CZECH REPUBLIC: Czech SPT falls sharply, pulls PSE with it.Czech SPT falls sharply, pulls PSE with it.Shares in SPT Telecom, as expected, suffered a strong downward correction on the Prague Stock Exhcange, pulling the bourse sharply lower.SPT shares gained 102 crowns just before Monday's session closed, but dealers had said the move was little more than a last minute accounting procedure, and that the rise did not correspond to market reality.By the end of the session, their words had been borne out with SPT shares losing 102 crowns to 3,339.The fall more than offset broader issues gains, dragging the PX50 index down five points, 0.88 percent, to 564.9.Overall, 201 shares gained ground on the day, while 134 fell and 65 held steady."Nobody is surprised by the SPT fall. This happens quite often here when someone moves the price at the end of one session, but the market knows the real price," said one trader.Banking issues fared well on the day, with Komercni Banka, Ceska Sporitelna and Zivnostenska Banka all posting modest gains.Most other major issues made only minor moves.-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2423-0003

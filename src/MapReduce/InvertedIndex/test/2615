SWEDEN: Saab says Chile mulling JAS fighter.Saab says Chile mulling JAS fighter.Saab Military Aircraft, part of the Investor-owned Saab group, said on Tuesday that Chile had requested information on its JAS 39 Gripen fighter as a prelude to a possible tender procedure."The request for information is the first stage in a selection procedure among possible aircraft," Saab Military Aircraft spokeswoman Pia Fores told Reuters.Other possible choices are likely to be the American F-16 and F-18, the French Mirage 2000/5 and possibly a Russian aircraft, the Mig-29, Fores said.The next step in the process would be a Chilean request for tenders from the manufacturer it selects, she added."Some time in 1998, Chile will decide whether the country is to buy new fighters, and if so, which. It could be a matter of around 15 planes in the first round," Fores said.She added it was too early to comment on how the financing of the purchase would be structured.-- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1006

CZECH REPUBLIC: Czech government to counter grain price rises - aide.Czech government to counter grain price rises - aide.The Czech government will counter grain price increases demanded by the country's farmers by use of various measures, including possible imports, a cabinet aide said on Tuesda.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's chief adviser, Jiri Weigl, told reporters after a meeting of ministers that this year's harvest would be sufficient to cover domestic demand and therefore there was no reason for price hikes."The state is ready to play an active role and take measures against price increases and the pressure of producers," he added.Czech grain prices have been several hundred crowns below the world market price per tonne, but Weigl said the governemnt would, in the short term, resist pressure from farmers by using the state fund for regulating food prices."Measures vary from influencing the supply from sources of the state reserves... to possible imports," Waigl said.He added keeping domestic prices low by buying more expensive government imports "would obviously cost something", but he did not elaborateGrain exports are subject to licensing by state authorities, and Weigl said licences would be granted only if the domestic demand was satisfied."(Liberalisation of the market) would mean that the market would aim towards...world prices, which would have serious impact on the development of inflation," Weigl told reporters.Farmers have demanded price hikes saying their costs have grown.Speaking about long-term grain market strategy, Weigl said that "most of the ministers" objected to the European Union (EU) system of guaranteed grain prices.The Czechs have applied to join the EU, but Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, has often criticised the Union's Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).-- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003

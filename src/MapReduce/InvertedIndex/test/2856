USA: Philip Morris says will defend against suit.Philip Morris says will defend against suit.Philip Morris on Tuesday criticized the Kansas attorney general's decision to join a growing list of states filing lawsuits against tobacco firms, seeking to recover Medicaid money spent on tobacco-related illnesses.Philip Morris said Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall is seeking to use the courts to "legislate public policy on tobacco."Philip Morris is one of nine companies named in the lawsuit.  "In her zealousness to jump on the bandwagon, the attorney general has ignored the fact that the state has no viaable legal basis upon which to sue the cigarette manufacturers," said Gregory Little, a lawyer for Philip Morris."The law does not follow what is perceived by some to be politically correct, and ultimately the state of Kansas will lose and in the process waste millions of taxpayer dollars in time and costs," he added.

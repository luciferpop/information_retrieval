USA: U.S. identity fraud is on the rise - government.U.S. identity fraud is on the rise - government.Identity fraud is on the rise in the United States, with criminals using stolen social security numbers and driver's licenses to take over their victims' jobs and mortgages, a government agency said Tuesday."The case histories that we see are frankly frightening," said Janet Steiger, a member of the Federal Trade Commission. "In a flash, the victim's credit record ... is destroyed," and it may take years to undo the damage, she said."The bureau ... has become more and more aware of the problem of identity fraud because we are receiving an increasing number of consumer complaints," Steiger said.She was addressing a meeting hosted by the FTC to start a working group of industry, government and consumer respresentatives on how to tackle the problem.Victims of such fraud have lost jobs, credit accounts, had cars repossessed, and some have lost mortgages and been denied college tuition loans, Steiger said. "In some cases they have been arrested for crimes committed by the criminal who stole their very identity," she added.John Smith, a general contractor from Bakersfield, Calif., said it took him a year to sort out the mess after someone grabbed his identity.The impostor applied for credit at dozens of businesses and put Smith's address as his previous address and a phony address as the current address, so nothing was ever mailed to Smith from any of the fraudulent transactions, Smith said."(He) received at least $50,000 in merchandise and services on my identity alone, and I was not the only one he was working," Smith said.The criminal obtained forged driver's licenses using addresses of recently vacated houses, Smith said.The man then went into a used car lot asking to test drive a truck and was asked for a driver's license, but claimed he forgot his social security number.The dealer ran a credit check and several names came up on the screen and the impostor pointed to Smith's name, saying that his address had changed as he had recently moved.The man was able to get enough information, including the social security number, "to set the chain of events in motion," Smith said.He noted that access to credit information should only be allowed if the person can supply a social security number.Solutions mooted at the forum included tightening access to credit reports, stricter and standardized requirements for obtaining driver's licenses and shredding old licenses rather than just throwing them away.

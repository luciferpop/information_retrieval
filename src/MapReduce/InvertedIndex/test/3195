RUSSIA: Yeltsin leaves for break in Russia's lakeland.Yeltsin leaves for break in Russia's lakeland.President Boris Yeltsin headed for the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday for a two-day break outside Moscow, the presidential press service said.It said that the 65-year-old Kremlin leader, whose virtual disappearance from public view in late June triggered rumours about his health, would consider whether it was a good enough place to spend the rest of his planned vacation."It is expected that Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow this week where he will hold a series of meetings with members of the government," a spokesman said.Yeltsin, who suffered two heart attacks last year, has made only one public appearence since June 26, briefly turning up at his inauguration ceremony on August 9.Aides say he suffered "colossal weariness" after his re-election campaign, but they deny he has suffered new heart trouble.Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, on Monday denied a report by the U.S. magazine Time which said that Yeltsin had suffered from heart problems again in the second half of June.Time said that, according to an official Kremlin medical advisory it had obtained, the president needed round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering transferring him to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation."This information is part of a series of rumours and conjectures concerning the state of the president's health," Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.He said that the president, whom he had met recently, has been doing paperwork every day at a residence near Moscow.Yeltsin, who usually spends vacations at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, had been expected to start a holiday outside Moscow after his inauguration.Valdai, about 350 km (220 miles) northwest of the capital, had been mentioned by aides as a possible destination.The area, a mixture of thick woods and hundreds of lakes where Russia's River Volga originates, is a long-time resort area popular for mild climate and beautiful nature.

AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Costello says opposes break-up of Telstra.RTRS-Costello says opposes break-up of Telstra.Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday the government did not favour breaking up state-owned telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp in order to privatise it.  Costello said in a radio interview that the previous Labor government probably wanted to break up Telstra and privatise its assets separately, but the new conservative government felt it was better to keep Telstra intact."We think that's better because we keep a major Australian company together as an Australian company and we can introduce private shareholding to make sure that it stays an Australian company in Australian hands as one whole ...," Costello said.

Futures -2 at 1,104  668   +1  * Other movers - +35 -6New Zealand share prices ended steady but off their peak on Tuesday on moderate turnover, the market reacting little to the Government's sale of Forestry Corp of New Zealand to a New Zealand-Chinese consortium.The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 0.54 of a point higher at 2,167.79 on turnover worth NZ$40 million.The Government earlier said that it had sold FCNZ to a consortium comprising Fletcher Challenge, Brierley Investments and China's Citifor for NZ$2.026 billion.  Most leaders were slightly firmer, the exception being Carter Holt Harvey, which lost five cents to NZ$3.15 after a disappointing first quarter result.CHH said earlier its first quarter profit was NZ$56 million, down sharply from $155 million a year earlier."I suspect that result is going to disappoint a few people," Luke Koekoek at JB Were said.Although CHH missed out on the purchase of FCNZ, it may prove a mild positive that the price was above expectations, which may rub off on CHH's own forestry valuations.  Koekoek said it had been a volatile session, the market moving down initially with CHH then recovering."There are still a lot of players on the sideline at the moment," he said.Australia's budget, due on Tuesday night, may have an impact on Wednesday's opening, particularly if it influences the New Zealand dollar and local rates.Progressive Enterprises was actively traded -- 5.20 million shares, worth NZ$5.99 million traded. The stock gained one cent to NZ$1.20. -- James Gray (64 9 302 1253)

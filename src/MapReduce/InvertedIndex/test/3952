UK: UK bankers sets new standard to reduce credit risk.UK bankers sets new standard to reduce credit risk.The international banking community is poised to sign new agreements in the interbank market which should reduce credit risk and boost liquidity.The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said on Tuesday it had launched a legal mechanism, called the Deposit Netting Agreement (DNA), for offsetting credit risks where two banks have lent money to one another.It is designed to protect banks against insolvency in the six trillion dollar interbank market and against the threat of an individual bank collapsing -- as Barings did last year.  The BBA expects the top 15 banks trading in London to participate in DNA.Barclays, one of the main drivers behind the new standard, is sending new agreements to its 30 or 40 international counterparties and hoping for a speedy return.Barclays signed the first of the internationally recognised agreements two weeks ago with National Westminster Bank, with whom it previously had such an agreement for the UK. Counterparties to these agreements will be based in Japan, Switzerland, France, Germany, the UK and the U.S.. More parallel measures are expected from the BBA within a few weeks.These rules will toughen up security standards in the tradeable certificates of deposit market as the Bank of England seeks to extend the range of currencies these can be traded in.New monthly lending figures from the BBA showed total lending by the major banks to the UK private sector rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.68 billion stg in July.This was less than the June increase of 3.34 billion stg and below the six monthly average of 3.3 billion stg. A rise of 539 million stg in consumer credit, compared with a gain of 266 million stg in June, was a key underlying feature.-- Christopher Adams, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7721

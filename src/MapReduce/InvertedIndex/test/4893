SWEDEN: Swedish think-tank sees upturn in industry cycle.Swedish think-tank sees upturn in industry cycle.Sweden's National Economic Research Institute (KI) said on Tuesday the country's industrial economy had bottomed out of its decline and a recovery was on the horizon."The industrial economy has stopped deteriorating, and a recovery has instead become discernible," KI said in its monthly economic barometer."Order intake is reported to have increased slightly, albeit only from the export market. On the domestic market, order intake has continued to fall over the past few months," KI said.The institute reported a recurring pattern of increased export demand throughout most trial sectors, whilst domestic orders were either flat or declining. However, the consumer goods industry showed no sign of a recovery in the near term."Order intake and production volumes have continued to fall, and the sub-group consumer durables is still showing the weakest development," KI said.

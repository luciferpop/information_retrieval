USA: Levi Strauss launches new slacks line.Levi Strauss launches new slacks line.Levi Strauss & Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who don't like suits, in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history.The new slacks, to be called Slates, will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its Dockers pants brand, but not as formal as suits.The pants, to be aimed at men in their 30s and 40s who grew up wearing Levi's jeans and Dockers khakis, are meant to give a big boost to the San Francisco-based clothing company, though how well men accept the new line remains to be seen, industry analysts said."We're going to awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential," Jann Westfall, president of the Slates brand, said in a statement.Those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual, "a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits," Westfall said.The pants will come in flannel, wool gabardine and other fabrics with a suggested retail price of $50 to $90 a pair, said Lory Cogan, Levi vice president for marketing.The new line will come in a broad range of styles, colours and sizes, and the pants in most cases will not require tailoring, which Levi hopes will lure men who want hassle-free shopping.Cogan said research revealed that men hate to shop for dress pants and believe "it's more enjoyable to go to the dentist" because they can't find what they need or like.Slates aims to change that when it makes its debut this fall in department stores, backed by a $20 million marketing campaign."They will probably dominate the market," said retail consultant Alan Millstein. He added that slacks are a small market with very few players, such as the Haggar and Farah brands.He said that Levi Strauss is trying to expand its business by going after the $1.9 billion-a-year market, but he doesn't see it as a "great growth engine" for the company.Millstein questioned how many pairs of slacks men would buy at the prices set by Levi's.A research study done last year for the company showed that 85 percent of American companies that had a traditional dress code were now allowing some form of more casual attire in the workplace.In a national telephone survey of men in their 30s and 40s, almost half of men who do not work in jeans or a uniform said their office dress code is somewhere between suits and cotton pants, according to Levi Strauss.Westfall believes Slates will allow men to express more individuality, youthfulness and personal style than they can in a suit. She said the pants have an "accessible style."The privately held company, which employs 36,000 people around the world, had global sales of $6.7 billion in 1995.

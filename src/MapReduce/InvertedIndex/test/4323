NETHERLANDS: European bunkers up again, trade generally slack.European bunkers up again, trade generally slack.European bunkers firmed on Tuesday as fuel oil barge prices rose and after Monday's late futures surge, dealers said.A feeling that prices would soon weaken left most business slack, particularly in the Mediterranean.Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil was at $99/$100 fob. Fuel oil barges traded as high as $99 fob ARA. Dealers said bunker demand was a reasonable 10-15,000 tonnes. A number of buyers covered early as prices began to rise but were dormant in the afternoon, believing futures' weakness would lead bunker prices lower.Hamburg prices rose in line with Rotterdam, but quoted levels were barely tested.In the Mediterranean, prices firmed sharply. The many enquiries did not amount to a large volume of demand, as most buyers were only interested in small quantities to cover essential requirements. Dealers in Piraeus reported no new demand until Thursday.Durban prices were reported firming as shortages continued to afflict the market. Dealers said supply should increase by late August.-- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040

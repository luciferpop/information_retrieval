BOSNIA: NATO presses on with destroying Serb munitions.NATO presses on with destroying Serb munitions.NATO troops in eastern Bosnia transported tonnes of contraband Bosnian Serb ammunition and mines to pits for destruction on Tuesday, pressing on with their "Operation Volcano" mission despite local environmental concerns."Serb worries about the local water table have halted work in one set of pits for the moment but the operation continues in a second set of pits," NATO's Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters."Operation Volcano is proceeding even as we respond to local environmental concerns. Theoretically we could destroy all the material in the second set of pits or find a third site. The material will be destroyed one way or the other."A total of 24 tonnes of munitions were destroyed on Monday in two sets of explosions which sent columns of dirt and dust 300 metres (1,000 feet) into the air.A routine NATO patrol discovered about 300 tonnes of small arms ammunition, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in a schoolhouse in Margetici, near Sokolac, on August 5.Because the Margetici site had not been declared to NATO as required by the Dayton peace agreement, NATO troops confiscated the material and prepared to destroy it.About 2,000 NATO-led peace implementation troops were despatched to the area from Saturday to ensure Operation Volcano went ahead without risk to local citizens or the environment.Military engineers dug two sets of blasts pits in a remote area near Margetici to contain the exploding munitions which they detonated in lots of a few tonnes each.On Monday the Serbs complained that blasts from one set of pits might contaminate local water tables.Blasting began in the other set of pits while NATO engineers considered the Serb complaint.Operation Volcano is expected to continue for the rest of the week.

AUSTRALIA: Australia govt grants banks pension accounts.Australia govt grants banks pension accounts.The Australian government announced on Tuesday it would grant banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies the right to offer customers Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), which give the same tax benefits as normal superannuation funds."RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk products especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts and those nearing retirement," Treasurer Peter Costello said in a statement.  "Their introduction will complement existing arrangements by increasing competition and choice in the superannuation industry, thereby putting downward pressure on fees and charges," he said.Those offering RSAs must advise their customers of 'balanced portfolio' products offering better returns when their balances reached A$10,000.RSAs would be eligible to receive contributions under the compulsory Superannuation Guarantee Scheme from employers and employees.  "The accounts...will be fully portable, owned and controlled by the member, and subject to the retirement income standards of superannuation products, including preservation," Costello said.Money in the accounts would therefore not be able to be withdrawn for consumption spending and should be held in a superannuation fund until retirement.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

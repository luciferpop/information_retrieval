GERMANY: German cocoa buyers take back seat in summer lull.German cocoa buyers take back seat in summer lull.German chocolate manufacturers have shunned cocoa markets during August after taking cover at around the 1,000 stg a tonne levels seen in London futures last month, traders said."Futures are trending higher and a strong sterling versus the mark is another deterrent," one said."The past few weeks have been the dullest in years."London September was up six stg at 1,020 at 1030 GMT.Industry was reasonably covered and not worried about price rallies while high summer temperatures discouraged chocolate consumption and some plants remained shut, traders said.Market speculation focused on an Ivory Coast harvest around 800,000-900,000 tonnes, which could bring a deficit of around 150,000-250,000 tonnes in the 1996/97 season."That's why I think the current consumer attitude might be dangerous given that fourth quarter prices may well be a few hundred sterling higher," another trader said."But it would be a creeping increase and there is also a danger of a price collapse if the Ivory Coast suddenly comes up with record volumes and qualities," he said.Ivorian beans were quoted at 2.30 marks per kg for Aug/Sept compared with 2.17 marks in late July while the fourth quarter 1996 and first quarter 1997 price of 2.33 was up 0.09-0.11.The cocoa butter ratio was marginally higher at 2.78 for 1996 dates, implying a 6.50 marks outright price for Aug/Sept and 6.45 for fourth quarter, liquid, ex-works.The first quarter 1997 ratio of 2.72 implied a mark price of 6.40.-- Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom +49-40-41903275

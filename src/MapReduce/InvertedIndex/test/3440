AUSTRALIA: RTRS-No hurry for election - Australia's Howard.RTRS-No hurry for election - Australia's Howard.Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday he was in no hurry for a fresh election."I'm in no hurry to have an election," Howard told radio 2GB.Some political analysts believe Howard, elected in March for a three-year term, may be forced to call an early election because of parliamentary obstruction of key reforms.  Australia's constitution allows a government to call an election if parliament blocks legislation twice within three months.Howard's Liberal-National government does not have a majority in the 76-seat upper house, the Senate, and needs the support of at least two non-government senators to pass legislation.But the Labor opposition and minor parties have pledged to block key reforms, including the partial sale of government telecoms giant Telstra Corp.  An election called because of blocked legislation allows a joint sitting of both houses after the polls.Political analysts believe Howard would win an early election with a lower-house majority big enough to guarantee passage of his reforms through a joint sitting.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

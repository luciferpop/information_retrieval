AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Fahey says private health to be monitored.RTRS-Fahey says private health to be monitored.Australian Finance Minister John Fahey said on a Wednesday that the government would monitor the private health system to ensure it provided services commensurate with costs following the budget's introduction of incentives for private health insurance.Asked whether the government would monitor private health insurance costs Fahey said: "Michael Woolridge has had many discussions with me on that as minister for health, to ensure that effectively there is efficient delivery of services in return for the benefits to the private health insurers."  Answering questions following an address to a New South Wales Chamber of Commerce function in Sydney, Fahey said the incentives were not a gift to the private health industry."I think it is a huge boost for our hospital system - there is very much a need for those that can afford to get into the private system," he said.The government announced tax incentives worth about A$500 million a year to encourage people to take out private health insurance and to wean rich people off the public Medicare health system.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

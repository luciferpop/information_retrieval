RWANDA: Fearful Rwandan refugees flee Burundi.Fearful Rwandan refugees flee Burundi.Aid agencies on Tuesday prepared to receive thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees fleeing Burundi because they fear for their lives after pressure from the Tutsi-dominated army."We are expecting some 4,500 refugees today (Tuesday)," Stephano Severe, head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Butare, told Reuters in this Rwandan border town.Severe said he expected Magara, the biggest of Rwandan refugee camps in Burundi with an initial population of more than 45,000 people, to be emptied within two to three days."We have got 65 trucks at the ready today (Tuesday) and if the returns continue like this, it will only be a matter of two to three days before we finish the repatriations from Magara," he added.Refugees at Magara Camp in northern Ngozi province said they feared for their lives if they stayed in Burundi and expected more intimidation from the army."We are leaving because they have burned our camp. We are returning to Rwanda because we are forced to go back and there is no security here," Joseph Murindahamwe told Reuters.His story was backed up by other refugees who said soldiers came every night since Wednesday with local Burundians burning huts, shooting into the air and telling the refugees they had to leave.In the Burundi capital Bujumbura, an army spokesman said the army would carry out investigations into the expulsions but he said the refugees had in most cases provoked troops."I will myself investigate to find out what is going on," Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi told Reuters. "But in certain camps, it is the refugees who provoke the army and Magara is a camp like that."Between 6,000 and 7,000 refugees returned to Rwanda on Monday leaving around 24,000 at Magara and 13,000 at Rukuramigabo Camp in neighbouring Kirundo province, Paul Stromberg, regional spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Reuters in a telephone interview.The repatriation effort was hampered on Monday because the road used by 25 UNHCR trucks to ferry refugees became impassable south of Butare in Rwanda, he said.Hundreds of refugees were forced to walk part of the way towards Butare and would have to spend the night at Butare stadium.Burundian soldiers triggered the stepped-up repatriation, killing three Magara refugees including a mother and child at the weekend, aid officials said.The latest expulsions came nearly four weeks after Burundi's new military strongman Pierre Buyoya promised to halt forced repatriation in an apparent effort to defuse international condemnation of his coup d'etat.Army intimidation at the camp could be the direct result of government policy, but it could also indicate Buyoya's difficulty controlling local military commanders, analysts said."We are caught between a military who are going to become more vociferous and violent and certain elements in the camp who do not want to co-operate and do not want to go home," Stromberg said.Around two million Rwandan Hutus fled their homeland to Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi in 1994 after Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu army and ousted the government, blamed for the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.Burundian authorities accuse the refugees of supporting Hutu rebels waging a guerrilla war against the Burundian army in which 150,000 people have died since 1993.

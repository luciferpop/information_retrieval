SOUTH KOREA: S.Korea expects rice output to exceed forecast.S.Korea expects rice output to exceed forecast.South Korea's rice output is expected to be higher than the original forecast of 4.85 million tonnes for this year against 4.75 million last year due to good weather and crop conditions, officials at the Agriculture and Fisheries said on Tuesday."Our initial target was 4.85 million tonnes this year. But we expect this year's rice output to be better than expected because of the favorable weather and crop conditions, despite less cultivation land," a ministry official said.A recent survey by the ministry indicated the amount of grain-producing land under cultivation decreased about 0.6 percent to 1,050,000 hectares this year against 1,055,868 hectares in the previous year, he said.South Korea's demand for rice is also expected to fall 10 percent to five million tonnes this year, compared to the previous year's 5.5 million tonnes, he said.-- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5651

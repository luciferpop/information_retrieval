They expect Costello to be firm," said a Sydney broker.With opening volume levels well up on recent starting levels, buyers had clearly jumped down from the fence they had occupied for the last week."Buyers from yesterday are still about and they have given it a bit of a go," the broker said.The big banks remained in favour as did cylical stocks such as transport shares Brambles and Mayne Nickless.Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about 14 to four, while about 41 percent of shares traded remained steady.

USA: Tennessee using reserves to cover $31 mln deficit.Tennessee using reserves to cover $31 mln deficit.Tennessee will have to dip into reserves to cover an estimated $31 million revenue shortfall for fiscal 1996, deputy Finance Commissioner Gerald Adams said Tuesday.The state is constitutionally required to balance its budget, but the slowing economy has caused revenues to fall below estimates made when the $13 billion budget was fine-tuned in April."It looks like we're going to be about $31 million undercollected in the general fund. We can cover that through available reserves," Adams said.He said the state could tap a $27 million economic development fund used to make grants to local governments to extend water and sewer lines to industrial sites."We do have other reserves available. That's not the state rainy day fund," Gerald said. "It's not touched and we do not expect to touch it."The rainy day fund contains about $101.4 million.Fiscal 1996 ended June 30. The actual deficit could be below $31 milion because under the accrual system used in Tennessee, most July revenues and some August revenues will count toward 1996."We're probably looking at the end of October before we can fully close out the end of fiscal 1996," Adams said.The state lowered its initial revenue projection by $58 million before fine-tuning the 1996 budget in April, but revenue collections have continued to slow.General tax collections for July were $552 million, or $425 million above the revised estimates. But the general fund portion, financed largely by sales and businesses taxes, were $2.4 million below revised estimates.Fiscal 1996 revenues rose by only 5.6 percent over 1995. The state's fiscal 1997 budget anticipates revenue growth of 5.6 percent to 6.1 percent in the general fund, and may also have to be trimmed.--Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013

SOUTH AFRICA: Marcus says S.African rand undervalued.Marcus says S.African rand undervalued.South Africa's rand, which touched an all time low against the dollar of 4.59 in overnight New York trade, was seriously undervalued, deputy finance minister Gill Marcus said on Tuesday.Marcus told parliament during a finance debate that the more than 20 percent devaluation of the rand since mid-February was "uppermost in all our minds".But she added: "There is no question that the rand is significantly undervalued and is trading at a level that is out of kilter with the sound fundamentals of the economy."Marcus's assessment contrasted with a report on Monday by Ivor Jones, Roy & Co/Deutsche Morgan Grenfell which said the rand was up to 12 percent overvalued.Analysts have attributed part of the rand's fall from around 3.65 to the dollar in mid-February to the fact that it was overvalued at the time.But most analysts believe the currency has now fallen below its true value.-- Parliamentary newsroom, +27 21 403-2502

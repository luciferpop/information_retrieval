INDIA: India reviewing policy on foreign airlines' equity.India reviewing policy on foreign airlines' equity.The Indian Civil Aviation Ministry said on Tuesday that it was reviewing government policy regarding equity stakes by foreign companies in domestic airlines.Currently the government reviews foreign companies' proposals on a case-by-case basis. If approved, a foreign firm can take up to a 40 percent stake in a domestic airline.  Gulf Air and  Kuwait Airways each have stakes in India's Jet Airways.The Economic Times said on Tuesday that the Civil Aviation Ministry had rejected plans to allow foreign companies to take future equity stakes in domestic airlines.But a ministry official said the government was still reviewing the policy and no decision had yet been taken regarding future investments by foreign firms."The thinking is that foreign equity participation by individuals is welcome," said the official, who asked not to be identified. "Equity participation by foreign airlines may not be permitted. But the matter is still under review."The official said the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which reviews foreign investment proposals, recently rejected a proposed joint venture linking Singapore Airlines (SIA) and India's Tata Industries.It was not clear whether the proposal could be revived.In February 1995, Singapore Airlines and Tata Industries submitted a proposal to India's Foreign Investment and Promotion Board (FIPB) to launch the joint venture airline.The Tatas were planning to hold a 60 percent stake with SIA controlling the rest.Since then the proposal has languished with the government.-New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

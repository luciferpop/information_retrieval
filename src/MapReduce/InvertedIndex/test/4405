BELGIUM: Rexrodt and Van Miert to talk about VW aid.Rexrodt and Van Miert to talk about VW aid.German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt is to talk to European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert on Tuesday, in a bid to cool a growing row about payments to Volkswagen AG, a Commission spokesman said."There will be a contact this afternoon between Mr Rexrodt and Mr Van Miert to see how to proceed with this affair and how to calm the proceedings down a little bit," spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing.Saxony premier Kurt Biedenkopf, a Christian Democrat (CDU) ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, overrode Commission objections to the size of a proposed package for the carmaker and paid out extra funds, contending the state stood to lose 23,000 automotive jobs in Mosel and Chemnitz if it didn't pay.Some 91 million marks are in dispute in the row that has worried Bonn by spurring anti-EU sentiment in the country, even from within the ranks of Kohl's conservatives.Bonn accepts Saxony's arguments that the payouts are justified, but believes the state went too far by defying the order from Brussels, an economics ministry spokeswoman said."Mr Van Miert is concerned about the tone of the public debate," van der Pas said.Van Miert warned at the weekend that Saxony could touch off a "subsidy war" in Europe if left unchallenged, telling Germany's Focus magagine Brussels could raise the stakes by blocking other AID to VW or excluding it from public tenders."You cannot simply break the law and hope the European Commission will close its eyes," van Miert said in an interview released ahead of publication on Monday. "This would be the end of the internal market and also of Europe."

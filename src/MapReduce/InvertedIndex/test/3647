USA: Shuttle Atlantis rolled to launch pad.Shuttle Atlantis rolled to launch pad.The space shuttle Atlantis, fitted with new rockets, was shifted to its seaside launch pad on Tuesday, bringing astronaut Shannon Lucid one step closer to home.Atlantis is being primed for a Sept. 12 launch to pick up Lucid from the Russian Mir space station, where she has been working since March. The 53-year-old mother of three was due home earlier this month, but NASA delayed Atlantis' flight by six weeks to replace two suspect rocket boosters.The shuttle made the slow, 3.4 mile (5.5 km) journey from its assembly building to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Centre, riding atop a giant caterpillar-tracked transporter.Shuttle managers ordered new solid rocket boosters for Atlantis after dangerously hot gas singed crucial seals in the boosters used to launch sistership Columbia in June.Rocket engineers blamed the problem on a change in the adhesive and cleaning fluid used to assemble the slender 149-foot-long (45-metre) boosters. Atlantis' new set of rocket motors was built using old, tried and tested materials.NASA is now seeking permission to continue using the old adhesive and cleaning agent, which was supposed to be phased out for environmental reasons.Atlantis, which will also carry Lucid's replacement to Mir, John Blaha, is now scheduled for launch on Sept. 12, but may still face a further delay because the Air Force has a prior claim to the launch slot that day.A Delta 2 rocket is scheduled to launch a military navigation satellite from Cape Canaveral on Sept. 12 and will use the same tracking and safety equipment needed by the shuttle.The Delta launch team is trying to speed up their launch preparations but if they cannot the shuttle will have to wait until Sept. 14."We hope the Delta can launch earlier, clearing the way for Atlantis on the 12th," said NASA spokesman Bill Johnson.

SRI LANKA: Sri Lanka Ceramic in rapid turnaround.Sri Lanka Ceramic in rapid turnaround.Lanka Ceramic, once a big player in Sri Lanka's domestic market but plagued with labour and other problems, is making a rapid turnaround, managing director Jagath Peiris said on Tuesday.The company suffered a crippling strike and a nine-month shutdown at its Piliyandala factory in suburban Colombo. The strike was resolved after the company pruned its workforce."Piliyandala has been operating again since January 1996. We have also begun to motivate labour, and started aggressive export marketing," said Peiris, who came to Lanka Ceramic in May 1995 from Dankotuwa Porcelain, where he was managing director.Lanka Ceramic has two other factories outside the capital.Management structures were being changed in all factories and at Colombo's head office to make them more flexible and responsive, Peiris said."We are getting on track and you will see results in 18 months to two years because there are no quick fixes."Analysts expect net profits of around 45 million rupees (about $818,000) for the half year to June 30, an increase from 17 million rupees (about $310,000) in the first half of 1995."Our 12-month forecasts for the company are 73.8 million rupees ($1.34 million), but we are reviewing the figures in line with new developments," said Avanka Herath, an analyst at brokerage Jardine Fleming.Lanka Ceramic's net profit in 1995 was 39.56 million rupees (about $720,000).The company is working to regain its local market share. It was a state-owned monopoly venture before 1992.Local market share eroded when Sri Lankans developed a taste for porcelain in preference to ceramics."This happened because we also sell other people's porcelain through our network of 200 dealers and 14 shops," Peiris said. "Naturally, our sales staff earned more commissions by selling pricey porcelain than our own less expensive ceramics."The company now motivates sales staff by offering more incentives to sell Lanka Ceramic products.Peiris said an average monthly wage of 2,700 rupees is inadequate in comparison to 7,000 rupees at Dankotuwa Porcelain, the star among Sri Lanka's five listed ceramic companies."We have compiled an export marketing-linked productivity incentive for the workforce to motivate them to manufacture exportable products," said Peiris.Peiris has re-established contacts with foreign buyers from his time at Dankotuwa."We are doing many new self-coloured, printed and hand-painted items to fall in line with what these buyers from Italy, Spain, France, USA and Netherlands want," he said.The company aims to export five containers a month in November and December and fine-tune production and management systems.Lanka Ceramic was privatised and listed in Colombo in 1992. The major shareholder, Uniwalkers, a local electronics firm, controls 35 percent, Noritake of Japan and the Sri Lanka government 18 percent each, and the public 29 percent.The share was last traded at 25.50 a 10-rupee share.(1$ = 55 rupees)

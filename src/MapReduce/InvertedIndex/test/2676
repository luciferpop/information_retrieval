FRANCE: RALLYING-MCRAE FINED $250,000 AFTER RUNNING INTO SPECTATORS.RALLYING-MCRAE FINED $250,000 AFTER RUNNING INTO SPECTATORS.World rally champion Colin McRae of Britain has been fined $250,000 -- $175,000 of it suspended -- after running into spectators in a service area during last month's Argentine rally.International Autosport Federation (FIA) president Max Mosley said McRae would only have to pay $75,000 provided he did not repeat the offence and was free to take part in the next rally, the 1,000 Lakes in Finland this weekend.  Mosley, speaking after a meeting of FIA's world council on Tuesday, said the offences, exceeding the new 50 kph limit covering rally service areas and failing to follow the correct route to a time control, would normally merit a suspension of one or two races.As a result of McRae's actions, five fans were slightly injured.In deciding against suspending the Scot, Mosley said they had taken into account difficult circumstances he faced.McRae, 28, said: "I am obviously relieved that this unfortunate incident has now been resolved."

U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to attend.Enrile said among particular concerns were Islamic militant groups such as Hamas.He said Hamas also has links with the radical Abu Sayyaf group responsible for a string of bomb attacks and the abduction of foreign priests and nuns in the southern Philippines."At the moment, we don't see them posing a threat because the security preparations have been very, very thorough," Enrile said.The Philippines said on Monday it would deploy a force of 10,000 men picked from the army and police when the APEC leaders meet on November 25 at the former U.S. Subic naval base north of Manila.APEC is a regional group which hopes to convert the Asia- Pacific region into a free trade zone.The members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

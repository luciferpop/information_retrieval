SWITZERLAND: Indian envoy vows to block nuclear test pact.Indian envoy vows to block nuclear test pact.India vowed on Tuesday to block a nuclear test ban treaty from being formally adopted by the Conference on Disarmament and sent to the U.N. General Assembly.Indian ambassador Arundhati Ghose, asked by reporters before addressing the Geneva forum whether she would announce her country would block a consensus on the treaty, replied: "Yes."  But Western diplomats said they were marshalling support for the global pact and if prevented from reaching consensus in the conference would send it to the General Assembly by using a special resolution.India last week blocked the committee which has been negotiating on the treaty text since January 1994 from formally adopting the pact and sending it to the main conference.Ghose, speaking before a conference session, said that making the treaty text an official document of the full conference would be "an assault on the institution".Asked whether she expected treaty sponsors to try to send it to the General Assembly, she replied: "That is the right of all states to go to the General Assembly. They can take what they want to the General Assembly."

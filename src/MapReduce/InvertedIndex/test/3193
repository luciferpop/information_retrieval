RUSSIA: Yeltsin takes break in Russian lake district.Yeltsin takes break in Russian lake district.President Boris Yeltsin started a two-day break in the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday, the presidential press service said, denying rumours that the Kremlin leader was ill.A spokesman said Yeltsin would size up prospects for a longer vacation in Valdai. "It is expected that Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow this week where he will hold a series of meetings with members of the government," he said.Valdai, in the Novgorod region about 350 km (220 miles) northwest of Moscow, has been mentioned by Kremlin aides as a possible holiday destination for the 65-year-old leader.Itar-Tass news agency quoted presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying the statement on Yeltsin's departure had been issued "in connection with the usual guesses and suppositions about the president's whereabouts".He dismissed as "complete rubbish" a report by Ekho Moskvy radio that Yeltsin had been in a specialist cardiological centre since August 15.Ekho Moskvy quoted informed sources as saying that doctors at the centre, named after heart specialist Yevgeny Chazov, had diagnosed the president's condition as of average seriousness."In the coming hours the question of carrying out a surgical operation may be decided," the radio said.However, it also quoted the acting head doctor at the centre as saying Yeltsin was not there. "You can come and see for yourself," the doctor said.Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were continuing to work on the formation of the new Russian government, most of which was announced last week.Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks last year and his disappearance from the public eye in late June triggered rumours about his health.Yeltsin has made only one public appearance since June 26, briefly turning up at his inauguration ceremony on August 9.Aides say he suffered "colossal weariness" after his reelection campaign, but they deny he has suffered new heart trouble.Yastrzhembsky on Monday denied a report by the U.S. magazine Time which said Yeltsin had suffered from heart problems again in the second half of June.Time said that, according to an official Kremlin medical advisory it had obtained, the president needed round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering transferring him to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation."This information is part of a series of rumours and conjectures concerning the state of the president's health," Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.He said the president, whom he had met recently, had been doing paperwork every day at a residence near Moscow.Yeltsin, who frequently spends vacations at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, had been expected to start a holiday outside Moscow after his inauguration.The Valdai area, a mixture of thick woods and hundreds of lakes where Russia's River Volga originates, is a long-time resort area popular for its mild climate and beautiful nature.

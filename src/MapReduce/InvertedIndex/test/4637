JAPAN: Mexico-bound Japan PM welcomes freeing of hostage.Mexico-bound Japan PM welcomes freeing of hostage.Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto departed on Tuesday for a five-nation Latin American visit, saying he was "relieved" at the release of a kidnapped Japanese executive in Mexico, his first stop."I was truly relieved to hear the news," Hashimoto said of the release of Japanese electronics executive Mamoru Konno, in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid.After nine days in captivity, Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.Hashimoto, who expressed gratitude to Mexican authorities and confidence in their ability to deal with any future problems, stressed that he believed Japanese firms "would not pull out or scale down operations in Mexico".Hashimoto's 10-day tour of Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica will be the first by a Japanese prime minister for seven years to a region whose economic growth is second only to East Asia.Tokyo has pumped nearly $60 billion into the region in the past 14 years as direct investment, and its economic aid in 1995, at $1.14 billion, was double the level of 1990.While Japan is the second-largest trading partner after the United States with Latin America, only about four percent of Tokyo's total exports make it to the region.Japanese officials said Hashimoto hoped to lay a basis for more investment in Latin America, greater exports and closer political ties.Hashimoto is slated to make a rest stop in Hawaii before returning to Japan on August 30.

The other victims were four crew, Garde's wife and three senior officers.The cause of the crash has not been determined yet but eye witnesses saw the aircraft hit a pocket of turbulence, twist upside down and fly into the cliff face near the airport.Denmark has been a member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) since 1948.

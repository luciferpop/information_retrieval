ARGENTINA: Argentine union strike vote becomes shoot-out.Argentine union strike vote becomes shoot-out.Argentine trade unionist rivals meeting to vote on a general strike call got into a shoot-out on Tuesday in which seven men were injured.Television showed men in union caps taking potshots with handguns and home-made flares at a union sports center outside Buenos Aires where the unions' Central Confederal Committee was meeting for a ballot on action against the Peronist government's austerity measures.The gunfight started after hundreds of truckers belonging to the hard-line MTA labor group tried to force their way into the debate and were blocked by officials from their much bigger long-time rival, the CGT union federation.Hospital officials said two of the seven hurt had serious injuries, one in the chest and another in the leg.The CGT, which led a 24-hour strike on Aug. 8 and wants a 36-hour strike next month, blamed the shooting on "outside groups who want to damage the image of the unions."Some CGT officials openly blamed the truckers and the MTA, a dissident labor group dominated by transport workers which criticizes the CGT for being too close to President Carlos Menem and wants next month's strike to stretch to 48 hours.CGT boss Gerardo Martinez refrained from blaming anyone, but apologized to "all the workers of our country" for the incidents and promised at a news conference the CGT leadership would resign if investigations showed they were to blame."I don't want to bear the responsibility for a single drop of my brother's blood," the burly construction union leader said.MTA leader Juan Palacios alleged the CGT "orchestrated everything from inside ... to get the strike called off as ordered by President Carlos Menem.""We are not delinquents; we are workers," said Palacios, who was at the meeting with 26 other dissident union leaders who make up just a 10th of the total of delegates.The CGT rescheduled the strike ballot for Friday, but the success of any industrial action depends on the support of the transport unions, whose backing in the Aug. 8 strike helped bring much of Argentina to a standstill.Unions say that stoppage was observed by 90 percent of workers, while the government termed it a 50 percent success.The union violence plays into the hands of Menem. Stung by their storming out of talks with employers on unemployment, Menem says they are incapable of coming up with alternatives to austerity measures aimed at narrowing a budget deficit.

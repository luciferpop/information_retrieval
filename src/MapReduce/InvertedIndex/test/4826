MACAU: FEATURE - East meets West over rice cake and coffee.FEATURE - East meets West over rice cake and coffee.In the narrow, cobbled streets of Portuguese-run Macau, a rocky outcrop on the south China coast, a humble rice cake has come to symbolise a meeting of cultures.The cake, a twist of traditional Portuguese pastry fashioned from rice flour, is called Bolo de Arroz. So is the popular cafe run by Luisa Castanheira."We named it Bolo de Arroz because rice cakes are a traditional Portuguese pastry and rice is associated with China, and here in Macau we are in China," Castanheira told Reuters.The cake shop, which doubles as a Lisbon-style coffee house, has become an institution among local residents and tourists, almost three years after its opening by the Castanheira family from Portugal."We are not just a cake shop and cafe but also a meeting place," said Castanheira, from Lisbon.Some local Chinese call the shop "the Portuguese cave," not only for its cavern-like layout but also because they consider it to be the territory's number-one hangout for civil servants on secondment for Portugal.She said that while most of her customers were Portuguese, there was an ever increasing number of tourists from Hong Kong and elsewhere, as well as local Chinese dropping by."The Portuguese tend to linger on, but many Chinese just come for takeaways," Castanheira said.For Macau's 4,000-plus Portuguese expatriates, the Bolo de Arroz is the ultimate culinary blessing in the twilight years of Portugal's rule over the territory, which reverts to China in 1999.For the majority Chinese population and foreign visitors, the Bolo de Arroz is one of the exotic attractions of Macau's unique Sino-Portuguese cultural -- and culinary -- heritage.In the local Chinese dialect, Cantonese, the shop is called "mai beng uk" or rice cake house.The Bolo de Arroz not only serves rice cakes but 100 other types of Portuguese-style cakes, sandwiches, cheeses and hams imported from Portugal.The shop is in the basement of a residential building on Travessa de S. Domingos next to Macau's main square, the Largo do Senado. It seats up to 40 people, including several tables on a mezzanine gallery.With the exception of a master pastry cook from Portugal, all its employees are Filipinos, some of whom have already picked up a smattering of Portuguese.Castanheira is confident her shop in Macau will be around long after the change in sovereignty.The family also runs three Portuguese restaurants in Macau, and is mulling proposals to open a Portuguese rice cake shop in the nearby British colony of Hong Kong, which China takes back in mid-1997.

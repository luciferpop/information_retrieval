BELGIUM: Belgians hopeful girls alive in international hunt.Belgians hopeful girls alive in international hunt.Police investigating Belgium's child-sex scandal are concentrating on finding two teenage girls abducted a year ago by convicted rapist Marc Dutroux, Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said on Tuesday.He said judicial authorities remain hopeful they will be found alive, as a hunt for the two became international, involving police across Europe."There are elements that allow us to believe that the two girls are still alive," Bourlet told a news conference in this southern town.Belgian media speculated the two had been found in the Czech Republic. However, Bourlet firmly squashed that rumour.At least 15 children have disappeared in Belgium in the past six years.Seven have now been found dead, six are still missing and only two have so far been rescued--from a dungeon-style compartment in a house owned by Dutroux. Both girls had been sexually abused.Dutroux led police on Saturday to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo -- kidnapped in June 1995 and starved to death in late February or early March.Thousands of mourners paid their last respects to the youngsters on Tuesday as a horrified nation sought to come to terms with the deadly scandal."We are focusing on trying to find An (Marchal) and Eefje (Lambrecks). We are still hopeful but unfortunately we have no news to report," Bourlet told a news conference.Dutroux has admitted kidnapping Marchal and Lambrecks in the port of Ostend last August. But their fate is a mystery."We are at the moment establishing contact with police in other countries via the services of Interpol," Major Jean-Marie Boudin, spokesman for the Belgian Gendarmerie's special missing children squad, told Reuters. "This process began today."He declined to specify which countries had been contacted. The media spotlight has been on the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and France.Boudin said the search also included Nathalie Geijsbregts who was 10 years old when she disappeared from the town of Berthem in February 1991.Dutroux was formally charged on Friday with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children after police raided a house he owned in Charleroi and rescued 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez and 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne from a makeshift concrete dungeon.Michel Lelievre was charged with same offence. Michelle Martin, Dutroux' second wife, has been charged as an accomplice, and Jean-Michel Nihoul was charged on Tuesday with criminal association.Dutroux denied responsibility for the deaths on the grounds that at the time he was serving four months in jail for theft. But he did admit having paid Lelievre and another accomplice, Bernard Weinstein, 40,000 francs ($1,300) for the girls.He also admitted killing Weinstein for letting the girls die. His body was found with the girls.The two girls will be buried in a private ceremony on Thursday followed by a televised public memorial service in Liege at which police expect up to 100,000 people.As the two friends lay side by side in white coffins on Tuesday, each bearing a brass plaque inscribed simply "Julie" and "Melissa", weeping people filed past at the rate of 500 an hour from early till late as Belgium poured out its grief.Against stern warnings from the prosecutor involved and his own mother, Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 from a 13-year sentence for multiple rape and child abuse.Police searching a house in a Charleroi suburb occupied by Lelievre found cells dug in the basement floor with evidence of occupation by children.Belgian television showed pictures of deep, narrow trenches. It said police believed Dutroux had kept kidnapped children in the trenches before passing them on for sex.Child rights lawyer Michele Hirsch told Reuters the Belgian case was symptomatic of a global sickness."Whether you talk about paedophilia, prostitution, pornography or the traffic in human organs, people are increasingly being treated as a primary resource," she said. "It is a a global problem."

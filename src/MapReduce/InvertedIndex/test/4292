USA: Louisiana-Pacific unit gets new Alaska permit.Louisiana-Pacific unit gets new Alaska permit.Alaska has granted a new air-quality permit to Louisiana-Pacific Corp's Ketchikan Pulp Co, based on a consent decree that mandates reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions and controls of several other air pollutants, state officials said.The permit, issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, includes "the most comprehensive compliance monitoring that DEC has ever required of an Alaskan company," John Stone, the agency's chief of air-quality maintenance, said in statement issued on Monday.Ketchikan Pulp operates a dissolving-pulp mill in Ketchikan and sawmills in the area. It is the dominant timber operator in southeast Alaska's Tongass National Forest.The consent decree was filed last Friday, DEC officials said.In addition to the new air-quality permit, the DEC proposed establishing a public communications forum to address community complaints about pollution from the mill.The program is modeled after panels used to review and manage oil spills and other such accidents, DEC said.

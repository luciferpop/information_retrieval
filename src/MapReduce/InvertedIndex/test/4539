AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Queensland cane growers expect record crop.RTRS-Queensland cane growers expect record crop.Queensland sugar growers expect a record sugar cane crop this year totalling more than 37 million tonnes, some two million tonnes more than in 1995, Canegrowers chairman Harry Bonanno said."Between June and December this year, about 6,300 growers will harvest over 37 million tonnes, our fifth successive record crop," Bonanno told a Sugar 2000 symposium.Bonanno also said Queensland growers expected to produce more than five million tonnes of raw sugar this year, four years ahead of their target date.  "This is extremely creditable when it is considered that it was only in 1993 that we exceeded four million tonnes," he said.If sugar prices remained reasonably attractive to growers, the Queensland industry had the potential to produce more than six million tonnes by 2003, Bonanno said.He told the sugar conference that increasing production efficiencies had seen the average 70 hectare farm producing about 5,600 tonnes of cane annually."But with this year's falling sugar price, we must continue to improve our performance if we are to cope successfully with recurring fluctuations in price," Bonanno said.  Queensland, the world's sixth largest sugar producer, produces more than 95 percent of Australia's raw sugar and virtually all its exports.In the 1995 season, Australia produced a record 37.39 million tonnes of cane, of which 35.30 million came from Queensland, and 4.98 million tonnes of 94 net titre raws, of which 4.73 million tonnes were from Queensland.Australia's raws output was the second highest on record.The minor New South Wales crop is all used domestically.-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

AUSTRALIA: RBA 96/97 dividend A$2.129 bln - budget papers.RBA 96/97 dividend A$2.129 bln - budget papers.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will pay a dividend of A$2.129 billion to the government in 1996/97 (July-June), budget papers show.Dividends paid by Financial Enterprise (Banks) will fall 2.2 percent in 1996/97 from the A$2.176 billion paid in 1995/96, the government said."The slightly lower dividend estimate in 1996/97 reflects the fact that no further dividends will be received from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, largely offset by an increase in RBA dividends because of an increase in RBA profits for the 1995/96 year," the budget papers said.  The government no longer receives a dividend from the CBA following the sale of its remaining interest earlier this year.The  RBA is required to pay its net earnings to the government after contingencies and appropriations to reserves under Reserve Bank Act 1959.Dividend payments for government business enterprises are expected to rise to A$1.389 billion in 1996/97, 2.7 percent up on the A$1.352 billion received in 1995/96, as a result of improved profit performances by both Telstra and Australia Post, the government said in the budget papers.  Petroleum royalties are expected to rise to A$289 million, a 45.8 percent increase on the A$198 million received in 1995/96.This is due to higher production levels on the North West Shelfand increases in forecast petroleum prices, partly offset by slightly lower production in some oil fields off Western Australia, the budget papers said.All up, Total Dividends and Other received by the government are expected to total A$4.009 billion in 1996/97, an increase of2.8 percent on the A$3.899 billion received in 1995/96.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

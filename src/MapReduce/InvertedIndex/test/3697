Other months ended $4.70 to $4.00 higher.Reports that cash spruce values continued to advance and were likely trading in the $415 to $420 per tbf area prompted short covering into buy stops at new highs."The amount of trading activity has slowed but the (cash) market still has underlying strength because the consuming end of the market is still good and there is not enough wood in the pipeline," said Paul Court, independent lumber analyst. "Markets top with excess and there is no excess (wood) around right now."Traders noted that mills have order files sold out into the second week of September. Wholesalers have also reduced offerings of spruce, they said.--Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725

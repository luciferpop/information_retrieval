USA: CBOT, CME oppose CFTC rule on trading errors.CBOT, CME oppose CFTC rule on trading errors.The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange said they were opposed to a Commodity Futures Trading Commission amended rule aimed at enhancing U.S. futures exchanges' audit trails and surveillance.The CBOT and CME said in separate statements that they already have exchange rules designed to detect fabricated or altered trades.The CFTC's amended rule specifies that a member of a contract market must correct an error on a trading record with no more than a single line.  If the error is illegible or obliterated, a copy of the trading card must be submitted to contract market personnel."We really think it is one of the highest forms of micromanagement," a CBOT spokesman said.The rules also apply to all trading records, such as orders received on the floor through electronic order routing systems and "flashed" orders, not just trading cards, the CFTC official said.  "This is a perfect example of how a regulatory body whose function is oversight just can't resist delving into the minutiae and becoming the micromanager of those they regulate," said CME chairman Jack Sandner.According to a CFTC official, the rule will take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. The rule is expected to be published on either Tuesday or Wednesday."The commission believes that this amendment would further limit the opportunity for the fabrication or alteration of trading records," the CFTC said in its proposal published in the Federal Register on June 6, 1996.  Last week, the CFTC said a recent re-testing of the CME and CBOT's audit trail systems failed to meet regulatory standards of 90 percent verifiability of times and sequence.The CFTC said the two exchanges must demonstrate to the commission that they had achieved 90 percent verifiability by January 1, 1997.Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;e-mail derivatives@reuter.com

UK: M&G joins fray to manage KEPIT.M&G joins fray to manage KEPIT.M&G Group Plc said it had submitted proposals to take over management of the embattled Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust Plc (KEPIT)."The only way to reduce the discount to net asset value at which KEPIT is trading is to look at unitisation," M&G spokeswoman Rachel Medill said.August 19 was the closing date for bids for the 500 million pound trust, which attracted record subscriptions for a British investment trust when it was launched in 1994. Unitisation means shareholders would then hold units in a trust that owned shares, rather than owning shares directly.

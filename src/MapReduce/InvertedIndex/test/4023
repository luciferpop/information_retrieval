TURKEY: Turkish lira/bond/forex closing report.Turkish lira/bond/forex closing report.The Turkish central bank lent banks 15.5 trillion lira of overnight money at 75 percent on Tuesday to ease a cash shortage in the market, after keeping rates at 74-74.75 percent during the day.The bank funded banks 10.3 trillion lira of overnight money at the same rate on Monday when the market closed at an average of 73.86 percent.Although the market opened with a shortage of 4.7 trillion lira in the morning, the lira weakened due to a firmer dollar/mark and the central bank's support for the U.S currency on Tuesday.The central bank raised its dollar rate for banks' compulsory currency transfers to 86,050 lira in the afternoon, from 86,000 at the opening. That was on top of a 150-lira rise in the morning from Monday's close.The lira fell to 86,070 per dollar from 86,000 at Monday's close on the central bank's rate adjustments and the dollar/mark trend.T-bill yields firmed by one-two points as selling emerged due to the cash squeeze.Bankers said Monday's 211-day t-bill auction, in which the treasury raised the yield to extend maturity, helped push those t-bill yields lower.The most active February 26 paper yield fell to 127.55 percent from 126.26 at Monday's close. Since Friday, yields have lost 1.74 points.Yields on the March 19 papers, sold at an average yield of 128.94 percent at Monday's t-bill auction, rose to 130.29 percent. --Tulin Aygunes, Istanbul newsroom +90-212-275 08 75

"They were charged for taking part in a video conspiracy fabricating the poor situation of the farmers.He said the identity of the other two was not known nor was it known what section they were sentenced under, but said he thought it was likely under a sweeping Emergency Powers Act.Win Htein, Suu Kyi's assistant was one of more than 250 NLD members arrested by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in a crackdown on democracy politicians ahead of a May 26 party congress at Suu Kyi's house.Aye Win, a relative and personal assistant to NLD leader Su Kyi, was also arrested in the crackdown. His family told Reuters on Tuesday he had not yet been sentenced.Most of the NLD politicians arrested by the SLORC were released after the May 26-28 party meeting took place. The government said at the time the arrests were made to prevent "anarchy" and unrest from the meeting.But a handful of the NLD members, including Win Htein, remained in custody and were sent to Rangoon's Insein Prison.

USA: U.S. spot prods stable in ACCESS trade after APIs.U.S. spot prods stable in ACCESS trade after APIs.U.S. spot gasoline and heating oil prices were stable in ACCESS trade late Tuesday after release of weekly API inventory data deemed slightly bearish by traders.In earlier NYMEX trade, heat futures fell 0.91 cent and gasoline futures slid 1.26 cents in a reversal of two days of sharply higher prices, traders said.The API data, for the week ended August 16, showed a seasonal 1.83-million-barrel increase in distillate inventories on the heels of several weeks of drawdowns and scanty builds.Total distillate stocks stand at 106 million barrels, almost 18 million lower than the comparable period last year, the report said.It showed a seasonal gasoline draw of 864,000 barrels, putting stocks 1.4 million below last year's levels. But the data showed a bearish 2.2 million build in reformulated gasoline stocks in New York Harbor."I'd call the numbers a little on the bearish side," one Gulf Coast trader said. "Gasoline is only a million or so barrels less than last year, so it's slowly building back to normal."

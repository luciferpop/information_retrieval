ARGENTINA: Argentina postpones briefing on U.S. beef delays.Argentina postpones briefing on U.S. beef delays.Argentine Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola has indefinitely postponed a news conference scheduled for Tuesday afternoon to express annoyance at delays in getting U.S. beef import approval, his office said.A Secretariat official, who did not want to be named, said the Argentine government was now carrying out talks on the matter and did not want to make declarations for the moment.Sola called the conference last week after a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said it will take until at least March for the finalization of a rule effectively approving the Argentine imports as free of foot-and-mouth disease. The official said there would also likely be a delay between publication of the rule and its implementation.The news caused an angry reaction from Argentine beef producers. The United States has granted Argentina an annual quota of 20,000 tonnes of beef.-- Jason Webb, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 318-0655

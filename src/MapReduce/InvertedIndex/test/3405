They said unionists appeared to have fired back.The Central Confederal Committee of unions was scheduled to vote at the meeting near Ezeiza international airport on proposals for a second general strike against the Peronist government's austerity measures. It would follow a 24-hour stoppage that took place on Aug. 8.The main CGT labor federation, which is normally close to President Carlos Menem's government but led the first strike, wants a 36-hour strike in September while other, more hardline unions want a 48-hour stoppage.CGT chief Gerardo Martinez, speaking to local radio, blamed the gunfight on "outside groups who want to damage the image of the unions."

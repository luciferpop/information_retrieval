UK: Russia exports gasoline to Europe in August-trade.Russia exports gasoline to Europe in August-trade.Russia has begun exporting gasoline to Europe in the past couple of months and volumes reached about 80,000 tonnes in August, European oil traders say.Changing demand patterns in inland Russia towards higher quality gasoline means demand for the "A76" unleaded grade, referring to the 76 MON, has fallen away.Export volumes are uneven, dealers say, but in August they ran at about 50,000 tonnes from the Baltic ports and 30,000 tonnes from the Black Sea.The low octane content of the gasoline means it has to be blended in storage terminals in Amsterdam or Malta before being sold on as reformulated gasoline to the United States. Otherwise it is simply sold as low octane fuel for East or West Africa.A76 cargoes delivered in Amsterdam trade at a discount of $20 to $25 to the European standard 86 MON regular unleaded grade, using an average of barge and cif cargo prices.Dealers believe the flow from the Black Sea could dry up in September because the Ukraine usually begins four months of gasoline imports around then and some consumers there can use unblended A76.-- Tom Ashby, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8145

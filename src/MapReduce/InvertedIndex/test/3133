SOUTH AFRICA: Predicting rand from finrand makes no sense - Stals.Predicting rand from finrand makes no sense - Stals.South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Tuesday he disagreed that the future direction of the rand had any relation to the past performance of the old financial rand."It makes no sense to try and work out an index value of the rand based on the financial rand. The situation is completely different today," he said in a telephone interview.The rand was knocked on Monday following a study by Ivor Jones, Roy & Co/Deutsche Morgan Grenfell which said it was as much as 12 percent overvalued against the dollar, based on a "composite rand index".The composite index incorporated the historical characteristics of the commercial rand and the financial rand, abolished last year."I think the underlying assumptions in that calculation are very difficult to justify," Stals said.-- Ben Hirschler, Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

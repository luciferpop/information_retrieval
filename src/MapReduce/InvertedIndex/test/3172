ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwe civil servants strike for pay.Zimbabwe civil servants strike for pay.Zimbabwean civil servants went on strike on Tuesday to press demands for higher pay, rejecting as inadequate recent salary increases of up to eight percent.Public Service Association (PSA) executive secretary John Makoni told reporters "a lot" of the southern African state's 180,000 civil servants had heeded the PSA union's call "to go to work and walk out".The chairman of the Public Service Commission (PSC), Mariyawanda Nzuwah, told Zimbabwe state radio the strike was irresponsible and unacceptable to the government and negotiation channels had not been exhausted.But Makoni said the government had left the union with no option because it was not prepared to look at workers' demands for pay increases of around 25-30 percent."We will not go back to work until the PSC and the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare review the situation," he said.Hundreds of workers were milling around government offices in the capital Harare on Tuesday morning, leaving only senior officials at their desks.Nurses from Harare's two major hospitals also walked off their jobs late on Monday, demanding higher salaries.--- Cris Chinaka, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9

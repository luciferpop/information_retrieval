USA: Plains feedlot cattle trade up $1 at $67 - trade.Plains feedlot cattle trade up $1 at $67 - trade.Plains feedlot cattle markets Tuesday morning were stronger, with light sales at $67.00 per cwt, up $1.00 from a week ago, feedlot sources said.About 500 head traded at $67.00 in Texas and western Oklahoma markets and about 600 sold in Kansas, they said.However, the cattle were said to be of lesser quality than those that sold at $67.00 last week, sources said. Most feedlots were passing on further bids at the $67.00 level."This has not opened the floodgates (on sales), because everybody wants $68.00," one Oklahoma cattleman said.  The prospect of $68.00 cattle was growing closer as more feedlots pass packer bids at $67.00 amid talk that several packers were short on cattle inventories and need to buy cattle, sources said."It looks like they're fixing to trade at $68.00, and once we get a few bids at that level, I think they (packers) will be buying cattle," a Kansas feedlot operator said.There also was talk that at least one major packer had already paid $68.00 for about two thousand head in the Panhandle, but the sale was not reported yet, one market source said.--Bob Janis 312-983-7347--

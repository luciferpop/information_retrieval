NEW ZEALAND: Hardie Boys says NZ no-confidence rules may change.Hardie Boys says NZ no-confidence rules may change.Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys said New Zealand may eventually opt to change the rules governing parliament so a vote of no-confidence would be taken only if there was a new government in waiting."One day we might get to the position -- and it would require a general agreement to do it -- that we should have a constructive vote of no-confidence so that the vote is for no-confidence in one administration and confidence in another, so you know what the alternative is. But we haven't got to that yet," Hardie Boys said in an interview with Reuters.  "Maybe experience will bring everybody to realise that should be done. It would make my position much easier," he said.The governor-general has "reserve powers" to appoint or dismiss a prime minister or in special circumstances to refuse a dissolution of parliament. All other decisions must be taken on the advice of ministers.Hardie Boys noted that even a caretaker government could remain in office until it lost a confidence vote.-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746

NICARAGUA: Medieval marriage laws under fire in Nicaragua.Medieval marriage laws under fire in Nicaragua.Under Nicaragua's archaic penal code, a woman who cheats on her spouse can be jailed for two years, the same sentence that a jealous husband could face if he killed his wife.Nicaraguan lawmakers recently took the first steps to overhaul the country's outdated penal code, although legal experts said there is still a long way to go in placing women's rights alongside a man's honour."The penal code is totally sexist. In its defence of the father's honour it sacrifices the rights of women and children," said Angela Rosa Acevedo of the private Centre for Constitutional Rights.Legislators last week voted to modernise family violence laws and scrap adultery as a crime for women. The bill still must be signed by President Violeta Chamorro before it becomes law, but lawyers praised the move as a good first step."(That) was the first step in the separation of law and morality in our society," said Sergio Cuaresma, a penal expert.Currently, a woman can be sentenced to two years in prison for adultery, while a man can have as many lovers as he wants, punishable only when "he keeps a mistress within the marital home or in a public fashion that causes a scandal," the law says.If a man murders his wife and/or her lover in the heat of passion after catching them "in the act," he can face two to five years in prison. He faces a similar term if he kills a man he catches in bed with his daughter, if she is under 21 years old.Dueling among men is still legal."The penal code needs to be changed because it collides head on with constitutional principles and has no relevance to the problems now facing Nicaraguan society," Cuaresma said.The code even requires a man's approval if a woman is to have an abortion to protect her health, the only kind of abortion legal in Nicaragua, according to Acevedo.While more outdated parts of the law are not adhered to, some cases are successfully brought to court based on the code, legal experts said.Nicaragua's Supreme Court is currently demanding an "urgent" reform of this "legal museum piece" to bring the country into the modern era, Acevedo said.

JAPAN: Japan coincident index up on stronger output - EPA.Japan coincident index up on stronger output - EPA.Japan's index of coincident indicators rose above the key 50 mark in June for the first time since February because industrial output-related indicators were slightly stronger than three months ago, an Economic Planning Agency official told reporters on Tuesday.The index of coincident indicators, which measures current economic conditions, stood at 55.0 in June against 30.0 in May.Coincident and leading indicator indices are compiled by comparing data with a set of figures from three months earlier.The official said March industrial output data had been particularly weak, which helped June data climb above 50.  Asked if the coincident index would stay above the 50 mark in July, the official said it was difficult to forecast and that much depended on July industrial production figures."If industrial output rises 4.2 percent then conditions will not be so severe," he said.The Ministry of International and Industry has forecast a month-on-month rise of 4.2 percent in output for July.

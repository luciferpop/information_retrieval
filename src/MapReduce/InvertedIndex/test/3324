BRAZIL: Brazil alters auto tariffs in WTO dispute.Brazil alters auto tariffs in WTO dispute.Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has signed a decree reducing to 35 percent the import tariffs on 50,000 cars to be imported from Japan, South Korea and the European Union over the next 12 months.Under the terms of the decree, Japan will be entitled to 47.5 percent of the 50,000 quota, while South Korea and the EU will be allowed 33.1 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively.  Japan, South Korea and the EU, as well as the United States and Canada have begun formal consultations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) arguing that a Brazilian regime for the auto industry is against WTO rules.Under the terms its regime, Brazil levies a 70 percent tariff on imports of vehicles from manufacturers without a production base in the country. Companies based in Brazil may import at 35 percent.  The decree "represents a pragmatic and acceptable solution to reduce differences of opinion over the basic points of the regime, under the ambit of the WTO," according to a copy of its text distributed to reporters late on Tuesday.Last week, an official at Brasilia's Japanese Embassy said Japan was unsatisfied with terms now included in the decree.Frederico Alves, executive secretary of the Brazilian government's Foreign Trade Chamber said the decree was a unilateral offer that could be revovked."We hope to resolve in the short term the questions raised against Brazil's automotive regime," he told reporters.  The decree concluded that the concession would be withdrawn if any member of the WTO decided to take their objections to the regime to a dispute-resolution stage.-- William Schomberg, Brasilia newsroom 5561 2230358

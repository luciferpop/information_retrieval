They said call rates appeared to be heading down."Some people were quoting 11 percent but I don't think there are any deals at that rate because of (availability of) RBI (Reserve Bank of India) refinance at 11 percent," said a dealer.Dealers said the secondary market in securities had almost died out following the recent spurt in call rates to double-digits.-- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000

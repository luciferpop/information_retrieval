Imports from the United States rose to C$14.49 billion in June from C$14.07 billion in May.Statistics Canada said total exports declined 1.8 percent in June, while imports rose 2.3 percent. The decline in exports was due to lower sales of automotive and energy products while the rise in imports came from machinery purchases. Imports increased from the United States, Japan and Europe.(For more information from Statistics Canada, contact 613-951-9647 or Marketing and Client Services Section, International Trade Division at 1-800-294-5583.)-- Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613-235-6745

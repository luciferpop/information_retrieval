POLAND: Polish reserve money below target in July.Polish reserve money below target in July.The average 30-day level of Polish reserve money, a cornerstone of the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy this year, was 31.861 billion zlotys, below the target set at 32.4-33.1 billion zlotys, the NBP said.  The reserve money range for August was earlier set between 31.93 and 32.63 billion zlotys.Since the start of the year the central bank has missed its monthly target only twice with reserve money exceeding the target in March and falling below the set goal in July.The NBP set the monthly reserve money level as its operational goal for this year through which it wants to control money supply and, consequently, price growth.Reserve money, also referred to as high powered money or monetary base, comprises cash in circulation, cash in vaults and banks' obligatory reserves.Under the NBP's policy, reserve money levels are of higher priority than short-term market interest rates.-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

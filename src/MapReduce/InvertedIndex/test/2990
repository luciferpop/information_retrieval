USA: US money managers bullish on US debt -- MCM survey.US money managers bullish on US debt -- MCM survey.Fixed-income managers grew more bullish on U.S. debt markets in the past week, according to the latest MCM MoneyWatch Inc asset allocation survey."Investors (are) still finding the need to be invested," said MCM money market analyst Peter McTeague. "Some reached for yield in corporate paper, while others moved out the curve into the five- to ten-year (sector)."The weekly survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark rose to 106.1 in the week ended August 19 from 105.8 percent in the prior week.  A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market. A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.In the "next likely move" category, portfolio managers representing 24 percent of total assets in the survey said they would "buy," down from 37 percent the prior week.Strategists leaning toward "sell" declined to nine percent, down from 10 percent in the week ended August 5.Sixty-seven percent of managers said they were "neutral" on the market, up from 53 percent a week ago.  Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 3.02 percent, against 3.05 percent registered the previous week.The survey showed 39 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, up from 34 percent in the previous week, while 36 percent underweighted it. The remaining 25 percent were "neutral."In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 39 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 26 percent underweighted them.The survey included 38 domestic participants, who manage about $90.0 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM.

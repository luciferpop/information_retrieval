RUSSIA: Russia's quota on Ukraine whites to be negotiated.Russia's quota on Ukraine whites to be negotiated.Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha said on Tuesday Russia would levy import quotas on Ukrainian white sugar only after negotiations."Work on sugar quotas is in progress," Zaveryukha told reporters at a news conference, but he said that the measures would be negotiated."It is not one-sided, Russia levelling quotas, it will be done in agreement with Ukraine."He did not say when a decision could be expected.Last week a Russian government commission recommended white sugar imports for 1996 and 1997 be capped at 1.5 million tonnes, per year, one million tonnes of which would be for Ukrainian.Zaveryukha and other officials say Ukrainian sugar is priced too low for Russian producers to compete.Zaveryukha also said there were quality worries on imports from Ukraine and other Commonwealth of Independent States members.-- Peter Henderson, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

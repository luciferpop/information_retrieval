SOUTH AFRICA: New figures underline ailing S.African tourism.New figures underline ailing S.African tourism.Hotel bednights sold to foreign tourists slumped by 29.3 percent in June 1996 compared to the year ago period, new figures from South Africa's Central Statistical Service show.The decline reflects, in part, a high comparative month since a large number of visitors came to South Africa a year ago for the World Cup Rugby tournament.But a fall in foreign bednights sold, to 137,141 in June 1996 from 193,881 in June 1995, underscores the sharp slowdown in South Africa's tourist industry.According to the South African Tourist Board, visitor arrivals in the first five months of the year grew just 0.2 percent, down from 30 percent a year ago.Much of the stagnation is blamed on violent crime which officials say is scaring off foreign visitors."The decline can be put down to perceptions about personal safety and the negative publicity which South Africa has received as a result of its crime problem," Satour research head James Seymour told Reuters last week.While most holidaymakers have no trouble, police figures show South Africa is one of the world's most crime-ridden societies. A total of 1.98 million serious crimes were reported last year, with only half solved, including 36,888 rapes, 18,983 murders and 66,838 armed robberies.Satour believes South Africa has the potential to increase tourism over 10 percent a year into the next century, after the market was kick-started by the country's first all-race elections in 1994. But this target is out of reach for 1996.Last year nearly 1.1 million foreign tourists visited South Africa. That was 50 percent up on 1994, but still a pinprick compared with the 40 million who flock to Spain each year.-- Johannesburg newsroom, +27-11 482 1003

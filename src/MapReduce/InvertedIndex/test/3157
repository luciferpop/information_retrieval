SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa's Asmal says state forests in trouble.S.Africa's Asmal says state forests in trouble.South African forestry minister Kader Asmal said on Tuesday about 146,000 ha of commercial forests under state control were the cause of "huge" financial losses and hinted that they might be privatised."In its present form it is anything but commercial," Asmal told reporters during a parliamentary briefing."I inherited these forests from the previous homeland administrations ... and the biggest problem is that they are 100 percent overstaffed," he said."I had an audit done and the picture that emerged is very bleak...the current excess expenditure over income is huge, which means a heavy drain on the fiscus," Asmal said, without giving figures.He said "some proposals" had been made on how to deal with the problem which he would discuss in the cabinet committee on privatisation."I cannot divulge any of the proposals at this stage," he said.

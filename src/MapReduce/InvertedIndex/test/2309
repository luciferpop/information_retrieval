USA: Japan, EU may aid U.S. in ag trade reform.Japan, EU may aid U.S. in ag trade reform.The United States may seek an informal alliance with Japan and the European Union to win world trade rules to assure fair play by state trading enterprises, an Agriculture Department official said Tuesday.A new round of world trade talks was scheduled to begin in 1999. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said earlier this summer that U.S. priorities would be elimination of unfair export subsidies and controls on so-called STEs.Richard Schroeter, deputy administrator of international trade policy for the Agriculture Department, said there could be grounds for Japan and the EU to assist the U.S. drive."If we look at export subsidies, can the United States and the EU afford to eliminate or further reduce their subsidies while certain practices of other countries, which can be equivalent to export subsidies are allowed to continue?" Schroeter said at the International Sweetener Symposium."I speak here, for example, of state trading enterprises, or some producer-financed operations. My view is that there should be equivalent disciplines to avoid disadvantaging our producers."So far, Japan, the EU and the United States have met market access commitments under world trade rules, he said.If other nations wish to see further market-opening steps, Schroeter said, "they're going to have to take part on this issue" of state trading enterprises.The U.S. view is that STEs, which often have monopoly control over imports or exports, can obstruct trade or engage in unfair sales practices. U.S. officials frequently cite the Canadian Wheat Board and Australian dairy exports in their complaints about state trading enterprises.In the previous trade round, Japan's import quotas and EU farm subsidies were major U.S. targets.

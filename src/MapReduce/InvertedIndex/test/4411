PORTUGAL: Portuguese bond report.Portuguese bond report.Bonds were nudging higher but liquidity was very thin on a day when the Treasury rejected all bids at its five-year bond sale.Traders said the market was going to remain on hold until after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Tuesday."There is no desire to do anything in either futures or cash," said one trader.Traders said that the Treasury decision was a clear sign that it was not prepared to accept any increase in yields.  Bidded yields had been expected to be higher than the previous sale on July 25 because of uncertainty over the FOMC and the fact that end-users were out of the market.They said demand at the auction only totalled 36 billion for the 20 billion escudos of paper on offer.The escudo was also calm.--Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035

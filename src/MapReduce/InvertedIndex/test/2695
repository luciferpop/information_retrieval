BULGARIA: LOW LIQUIDITY PUSHES BULGARIAN LEV TO 199 PER DLR.LOW LIQUIDITY PUSHES BULGARIAN LEV TO 199 PER DLR.The Bulgarian lev slipped to 198.60-199.00 per dollar in low volumes from opening at 198.00/50 on the interbank market as foreign currency supply continued to fall, dealers said."The lev retreated to 199 per dollar due to a general reluctance of market makers to offer foreign currency as they expect the lev to fall further," a commercial bank dealer said.Banks bid for low foreign currency volumes, mostly on behalf of final clients, but supply was even lower, which put the lev under growing pressure, another dealer said.The central bank was not detected in the market in the morning, dealers said. Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment. -- Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 981 8569

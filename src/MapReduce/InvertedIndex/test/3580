SINGAPORE: S. Korean refiners struggle to sell Sept diesel.S. Korean refiners struggle to sell Sept diesel.South Korean refiners are struggling to sell their gas oil (diesel) cargoes for September lifting despite the sharp price hike in Singapore, traders said on Tuesday."There are about seven to ten 30,000-tonne cargoes that are unsold for September loading," a South Korean trader said.South Korean refiners are offering these cargoes at about 40 cents per barrel above Singapore spot prices on a free-on-board (fob) Korea basis, but no buyers have emerged.  "Even at a 30-cent premium we cannot ship the cargoes to China as the Singapore spot prices are very high," a Korean trader said. Singapore prices provide the benchmark for product pricing in South Korea.Traders said Chinese buyers were willing to pay up to $193/tonne cost-and-freight basis to South China. But at prevailing spot prices in Singapore, these cargoes would land in China at least at $200 per tonne, c-and-f.Spot gas oil prices in Singapore were last quoted at a high of about $25.70 a barrel or about $191 per tonne, fob on large purchases by traders.  A total of four cargoes of between 150,000-to-240,000 barrels each traded in Singapore on Monday at between $25.65 and 25.75 a barrel, traders said.One trader said the Koreans were having problems selling their gas oil as it is priced off Singapore spot prices which are based on different economics.This is because the higher Singapore prices are sustained by spot purchases from Indonesia and trades covering recent sales to India and Nepal, the trader said.The Korean barrels, on the other hand, have only one market for now, China.  It was therefore not economical for Korean gas oil to be shipped further south beyond Thailand since Singapore has a greater freight advantage, another trader said.In recent days, trading firms with Korean barrels were forced to take a risk and sell their cargoes at a possible loss in order to dispose off the product due to a lack of demand in North Asia.But not many are willing to take this risk. Korean refiners are hoping for a downward correction in Singapore spot prices that would allow them to export again, the Korean trader said.--Singapore Newsroom (+65-8703093)

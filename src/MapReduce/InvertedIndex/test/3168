NIGER: Niger lowers millet price to fight inflation.Niger lowers millet price to fight inflation.The government of Niger has lowered the price of staple millet to fight inflation which rose by 7.8 percent in the first seven months of 1996, compared to five percent for calendar 1995.A trade ministry statement said on Monday the government had instructed the office which manages buffer stocks to supply a 100 kg (220 lb) sack of millet at 10,000 CFA francs ($19.65) to merchants in the capital, provided their taxes are up to date.In the past four months, the market price has risen from 8,000 CFA to 15,000 CFA in Niamey and 18,000 CFA in the interior. The statement said local authorities would fix the price for provincial towns.Price rises are blamed on a 300,000 tonne deficit for the 1995 harvest as well as the rising cost of goods imported from neighbouring Nigeria.Niger's 40,000 civil servants are owed around five months wage arrears and the state treasury currently has a deficit of 200 billion CFA.($=509 CFA)-- Abidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90

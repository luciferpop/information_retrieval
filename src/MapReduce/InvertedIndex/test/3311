RUSSIA: Russian commander vows to oust rebels from Grozny.Russian commander vows to oust rebels from Grozny.Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, vowed on Tuesday to oust Chechen rebels from the capital Grozny."Grozny will without fail be cleared of rebel fighters," Pulikovsky told Interfax news agency.  The commander was speaking after warning the people of Grozny they should leave by Thursday or risk being caught up in an all-out Russian air and ground assault against rebel positions in the city.His remarks contrasted with the position of Kremlin security supremo Alexander Lebed, who has promoted talks with separatist representatives and opposed the use of aircraft. Rebel fighters occupied much of Grozny on August 6."We do not intend to put up with the brazen and barbaric actions of illegal groups who are continuing to shoot down our helicopters, carry out bold acts of sabotage and surround Russian servicemen," Pulikovsky said."I see only methods of force as a way out of the situation in Grozny," he said, adding that both aircraft and heavy artillery would be used. He believed it could take at least a month to overcome the rebels in the city.

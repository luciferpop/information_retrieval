The two men were charged on Friday after police rescued two abducted young girls from a house owned by Dutroux.The murdered eight-year-olds had been sexually abused, starved to death and buried in a garden after being kidnapped in June 1995.Dutroux denied responsibility for the girls' deaths, telling police they died of starvation in late February or March while he was serving a four-month prison sentence for theft.Dutroux's wife Michelle Martin was charged on Monday with being an accomplice in the abduction and illegal imprisonment of children.In the West case, Rosemary West continues to protest her innocence. She was found guilty in November 1995 of murdering 10 women. Frederick  confessed to killing 12 women and girls but hanged himself in prison before he could face trial.Their victims were mainly isolated young women whose disappearance went unnoticed. But they also killed their 16-year-old daughter Heather, Fred's eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine and a lodger who was pregnant with Fred's child.The pair picked up girls and sexually tormented them before killing and burying them at their house.

MEXICO: Japan to loan Mexico $940 mln during PM's visit.Japan to loan Mexico $940 mln during PM's visit.Japan will extend credits worth $940 million to Mexico during this week's visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hasimoto, a Foreign Ministry official said on Monday.Juan Rebolledo Gout, an undersecretary in the Foreign Ministry, said the credits -- aimed at ecological projects, small- and medium-sized firms and Mexican exporters -- would be signed by Mexican and Japanese officials on Wednesday.He gave no details of the breakdown for each loan, or the terms.The support comes as Hashimoto seeks to open up a new trade front for Japanese industry in Latin America. Tokyo has already pumped nearly $60 billion in direct investment into the region over the past 14 years and its economic aid doubled between 1990 and 1995 to $1.14 billion.Mexico marks the first stop on a five-nation, 10-day tour that will also take him to Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica.A potential cloud was lifted on Monday from Hashimoto's visit to Mexico when kidnappers released a top Japanese electronics executive in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid.After nine days in captivity, Mamoru Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.It was the first kidnapping of a high-ranking foreign businessman in Mexico in recent years, and has sparked fears that foreigners will re-think investment plans for the bustling trade zones along the U.S. border.The foreign ministry official was quoted by the state news agency Notimex as saying President Ernesto Zedillo would discuss the kidnapping with Hashimoto, and assure him Konno's life was his government's top priority.The Japanese premier is also expected to seek assurances from Zedillo about safety for Japanese firms that move to Mexico to take advantage of access to the U.S. and Canadian markets via the North American Free Trade Agreement.

USA: NY Sen Leichter says NYC does not get "fair share".NY Sen Leichter says NYC does not get "fair share".A New York State Senator, who represents Manhattan and The Bronx, on Tuesday charged the Pataki Administration with "geographic patronage," saying New York City is not getting its fair share of state assistance.Franz Leichter, a Democrat, said the number of economic development grants and loans awarded to New York City fell sharply after Gov. George Pataki won the 1994 election, even though the city has 40 percent of the state's businesses.New York City has been penalized, along with Albany, for not voting for Pataki, who is a Republican, Leichter said, adding that areas like Westchester, Long Island and Upstate regions that supported Pataki have gotten a bigger share.Long Island got 27 percent of all the grants, nearly twice as many as any other area, he said. The senator noted that a key adviser of Pataki, U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, and the chairman of the Empire State Development Corp, Charles Gargano, both reside on Long Island.Because New York City is the biggest force in the state's economy, the Pataki Administration's unfair division of state assistance has crimped the state's overall growth, in addition to hurting the city, where unemployment has risen, he said."The governor's economic development program has been more geared toward rewarding political supporters than spurring job creation and economic growth," Leichter said, in prepared remarks  released at a news conference held at City Hall.The senator pointed to the state's unemployment rate, saying it stagnated at 6.1 percent from January 1995, when Pataki took office, through June of 1996. In July, the state's unemployment rate rose to 6.6 percent, while the measure shot up to 9.1 percent in New York City, the Labor Department said.A spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corp gave short shrift to the senator's study, saying the release was a political attack and that she could not confirm the data. She blasted Leichter for not addressing the high unemployment rate when Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, was governor."Franz Leichter fails to say that his type of liberal policies are responsible for New York State hemorhaging 500,000 jobs betweeen 1989 to 1994," the spokeswoman said.The city has received substantial assistance from the Pataki Administration, she added, citing $32 million provided by the state to redevelop 42nd Street and a $100 million commitment for the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.To keep the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and New York Cotton Exchange in downtown Manhattan, the state and city are splitting the cost of a $98.5 million package to help them build a new site. The New York Mercantile Exchange, which will share the facility, got a smaller package, she said.According to Leichter's analysis, the city's five boroughs got 47 grants and loans, 14 percent of the 328 that were handed out throughout the state. The total number of applications for such assistance were not provided.When measured in dollars, the city's share fell to nine percent or $7.6 million out of a total of $86 million of grants.Five of the state's nine other regions got more grant money, with firms in the Finger Lakes getting $17.2 million. Those in the mid-Hudson Valley got $13.6 million, the Southern Tier got $9.3 million, Western New York received $8.7 million, and central New York obtained $8.3 million.Small businesses also suffered, Leichter said, as in 1995, ones located in New York City got three percent of the 33 projects that were approved, or $1.07 million of the $10.95 million allocated.--Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654

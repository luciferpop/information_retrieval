SOUTH KOREA: Korea won devaluation could cut profits - analysts.Korea won devaluation could cut profits - analysts.South Korea is encouraging a depreciation of its currency to try to boost flagging exports, but the move could backfire and spark inflation, analysts said on Tuesday.A lower won could also eat into corporate profits, they warned."It does look like the Koreans are forcing the won down very sharply, not especially against the U.S. dollar but rather the yen," Graham Courtney, an economist with SBC Warburg in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television (RFTV).Andrew Holland, head of research at BZW Securities in Seoul, told RFTV a weaker won was not the miracle cure South Korea was looking for to cut its rising trade deficit and boost competitiveness against Japan.The two analysts also said the South Korean stock market was expected to decline further."We expect more bad news. I don't think we've had all the bad news concerning the economy yet, and I think that will force the market down further," said Holland.The composite stock index closed down 6.61 points to 793.91 on Tuesday.While the finance ministry has officially stated that it has no intention of interfering in the currency market, foreign exchange dealers have said that, unofficially, it has encouraged a devaluation of the won.The central Bank of Korea (BOK) allowed the won to fall to a six-year low of 826.10 against the dollar last week before stepping in to ease the local unit's decline, traders said.The BOK has denied ever intervening in the interbank market.The won closed at 819.70 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday while the yen traded at 107.90 against the dollar."What they're doing at the moment is a messy intervention, and this could have implications regarding inflation later on," Holland said.As the won falls against the dollar or yen, raw material imports necessary to feed growing exports would become more expensive, fuelling price increases.New Finance Minister Han Seung-soo, appointed during a cabinet reshuffle on August 8, has repeatedly emphasised the government's commitment to keeping inflation in check. The central bank has forecast that inflation would remain at 4.5 percent this year."Producer prices do go straight up as the won goes down, particularly against the yen, but the Koreans have a history of managing to stop producer price pressures from coming through to the consumer price index," said Courtney."However, profits are likely to go out the window if the margins are squeezed even more by the fact that the pressures won't be passed on to the consumers," he added.

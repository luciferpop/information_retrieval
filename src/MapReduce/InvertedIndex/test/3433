GUATEMALA: U.N. says Guatemala progress slow in human rights.U.N. says Guatemala progress slow in human rights.A U.N. mission in Guatemala said on Monday insufficient progress had been made on human rights, as death threats and kidnappings remained unchecked by the country's judiciary and police.In a report made available to the media on Monday, the U.N. human rights mission also hailed the government's efforts in moving ahead on peace negotiations with leftist rebels."The mission highly values the political will of the Guatemalan government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit to leave arms behind and finish with war," David Stephen, the director of the United Nations Mission for Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala, told reporters.Stephen presented the report -- the mission's fifth in more than two  years -- to President Alvaro Arzu and commanders of leftist rebels last week.The mission, in Guatemala since late 1993, investigates allegations of human rights abuses, promotes human rights education and monitors implementation of peace accords to end Guatemala's 36-year civil war.Stephen told a news conference that Guatemala still had an alarming number of death threats and kidnappings and that the population lacked confidence in the justice system.Other problems were ineffective courts and security forces and the army's refusal to cooperate with criminal investigations into members of its forces, he added.The report said that a high percentage of the prison population is composed of persons accused of petty crimes."In other, serious cases, however, in which there is evidence pointing to the liabiity of the defendant, release has been granted, generating a lack of confidence in the justice system among the population," it added.

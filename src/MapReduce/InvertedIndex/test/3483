AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Budget fails to dazzle Australia dollar, bonds.RTRS - Budget fails to dazzle Australia dollar, bonds.The Australian dollar and bonds both went into quick retreat amid mild disappointment that Treasurer Peter Costello's first federal budget was not as tough as the government had led the markets to believe.By 8.35 GMT the dollar had sunk to US$0.7860/0.7865 from a pre-budget US$0.7883/88, while long dated bond yields rose some eight basis taking the November 2006 bond back up 8.0 percent."It wasn't a complete disappointment, but this is the first of supposedly extremely tough budgets and it doesn't quite live up to expectations," said UBS chief economist Stephen Roberts.  The Treasurer announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after budget savings of A$3.9 billion.Median forecasts had centred on an underlying deficit of A$4.9 billion and a headline surplus of A$1.0 billion.A total borrowing requirement of A$7.0 billion for 1996/97 was also larger then some analysts had expected.  The local bond market had rallied strongly in recent days in anticipation of a fiscal squeeze, but had been looking for cuts of over A$4.0 billion to maintain the momentum that had taken yields to their lowest level since March 1994.  The local dollar also lost its gloss after to advancing to a three-week high of US$0.7933 at the start of the day amid repeated comments by the Australian government that the budget would pave the way for a further reduction in interest rates."If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy," Costello said.The dollar slid to US$0.7700 after last month's surprise 50 basis points cut in official interest rates to 7.0 percent as it eroded the currency's yield advantage, and there are fears that a further reduction could send it to US$0.7600.  "The next hurdle is going to be the passage of the budget through the Senate," said Bruce Freeland, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "Difficulties in passing the budget have previously led to downward pressure on the Australian dollar and higher bond yields."However, he added that recent statements by the minor parties in the Senate would seem to reduce the probability of the budget being blocked.The Treasury also painted a rosy outlook for the economy with growth forecast to average 3.5 percent over 1996/97 and underlying inflation at 2.75 percent.  "Net, it is probably mildly bearish for the markets because it was such a favourable economic outlook rather than any failure on the fiscal tightening that Costello had been building us up for," said Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia.Second quarter GDP was also released at the time of the budget, rising 0.1 percent in the quarter for an annual growth rate of 4.5 percent.Median forecasts had centred on a flat outcome with the year-on-year rate at 3.9 percent,-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

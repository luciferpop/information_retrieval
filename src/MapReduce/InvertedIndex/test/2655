"We're both nervous because we respect each other and appreciate each other's games."Woodbridge had a double-break point to lead 3-0 in the second set after taking the first set with a service break in the eighth game.But Woodforde saved both break points and then won four games in a row, capitalising on three Woodbridge double faults in the sixth game to go ahead 4-2."When Mark got up 4-2 and started to be more aggressive, I got a little tentative," Woodbridge said. "I was lucky to get back to 4-4 straightaway. Mark let me back in that second set with a couple of errors."The Corretja-Forget match, played on the hard-court surface at the National Tennis Centre in Toronto, featured many exciting and extended rallies."He didn't play well in the first set but then he played better in the second set and I began to doubt myself," said Corretja."Then I played an unbelievable game, three passing shots and a topspin lob, to break him for 5-3 in the third set.""He hit four winners and played a perfect game to break me so I can't be too upset," said the 58th-ranked Forget, who was playing his first match in a month after a back ailment.Corretja and Forget are two of a record 36 Europeans in the 56-player Canadian Open field.With this year's tournament date changed from late July to a week before the U.S. Open because of the Olympics, the Europeans were more inclined to play in Toronto in order to get ready for Flushing Meadows.However, the top four Americans -- Pete Sampras, Michael Chang, Andre Agassi and Jim Courier, regulars at this ATP Tour Super Nine event -- have decided to skip it this year.The tournament's top seed is second-ranked Thomas Muster of Austria.

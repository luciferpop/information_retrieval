NIGERIA: Nigerian prices surge seen as temporary - analysts.Nigerian prices surge seen as temporary - analysts.Analysts said they saw the surge in Nigeria's month-on-month inflation to 5.5 percent in May from 1.3 percent in April as a temporary phenomenon.The Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), which announced the data on Tuesday, attributed the surge largely to big increases in the cost of food, personal household items and educational materials.Despite the jump in the month-on-month rate, year-on-year inflation slipped to 31.0 percent from 31.8 percent.Explaining the month-on-month surge, one Lagos-based analyst said: "(Petroleum Trust Fund) money was in circulation in the banks in May driving up demand for foreign exchange. On top of that smugglers found ways around new ports procedures introduced in April and had to factor in the extra costs."The government's Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was set up in 1994 to cushion the blow of the domestic fuel price hike.Another analyst said: "The May figures are just a blip. When we see June and July figures inflation should be right down again.The slight strengthening of the naira against foreign currencies will help to reduce inflation in the import-dependent economy. The naira has dropped to 80 naira to the dollar at weekly central bank foreign exchange auctions from 85 naira earlier in the year."It's what manuafacturers had been hoping for, but demand is still not increasing and if it does then so will wage claims and quite possibly inflation too," said one banker.The battle against inflation in sub-Saharan Africa's largest economy is the key point of tight fiscal policy set out by military ruler General Sani Abacha.Inflation figures tend to be late and disputed by independent analysts, but there is a consensus that Nigeria has left behind the rampant inflation triggered by a four-fold increase in petrol prices in October 1994.--Lagos newsroom +234 1 2630317

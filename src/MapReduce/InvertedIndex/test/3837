The television said police believed Dutroux had kept kidnapped children in the trenches before passing them on for sex.Dutroux was charged on Friday after police rescued 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez and 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne from a makeshift dungeon in another of his houses in Charleroi.The convicted child rapist then led police to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of Dutroux' houses at Sars-La-Buissiere near Charleroi.The two girls were kidnapped in June 1995. They starved to death in February or March this year.Dutroux has also admitted abducting teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks in August last year.Their whereabouts are unknown, but Belgian police contacted a number of other countries on Tuesday through Interpol in search of clues.

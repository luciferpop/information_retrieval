Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the local interbank market to keep a check on liquidity or set interest rates as part of its efforts to fight inflation.  But, it has not been in the market since May 24 despite rising liquidity that has pressured rates downward, threatening to thwart the Bank's tight monetary policy.Money market dealers said the intervention indicated that Bank Negara has not eased its tight monetary policy.While the volume that Bank Negara took was not known, it was expected to give a psychological boost to interest rates, particularly for short-term rates, dealers said.- Madhav Reddy (603-230 8911)

MEXICO: Japanese prime minister arrives in Mexico.Japanese prime minister arrives in Mexico.Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto arrived in Mexico on Tuesday on the first leg of a five-nation, 10-day tour of Latin America.Although Hashimoto made no comments to reporters upon his arrival at the Mexico City airport just before 11:30 a.m. EDT (1530 GMT), he was expected to announce credits to Mexico worth $940 million during his three-day trip, Mexican officials said.Deputy Foreign Minister Juan Rebolledo Gout said on Monday that the credits -- aimed at ecological projects, small- and medium-sized firms and Mexican exporters -- would be signed by Mexican and Japanese officials on Wednesday.The support comes as Hashimoto seeks to open a new trade front for Japanese industry in Latin America. Tokyo has already pumped nearly $60 billion in direct investment into the region over the past 14 years and its economic aid doubled between 1990 and 1995 to $1.14 billion.Hashimoto will hold talks with President Ernesto Zedillo on Wednesday and will meet members of the Japanese-Mexican community during his stay.Mexico was the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica.A potential cloud over his trip was lifted on Monday when kidnappers released a top Japanese electronics executive in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid.After nine days in captivity, Mamoru Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.

ISRAEL: Israel says it doesn't want trouble with Syria.Israel says it doesn't want trouble with Syria.Israel said on Tuesday it did not want a confrontation with arch foe Syria a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned problems in Lebanon would be bad for Damascus."There is no intention to heat up the border with Syria," an Israeli government source who spoke on condition he not be named told Reuters.The remarks also followed an Israeli Channel Two television report on Monday that Syria had tested a long-range Scud missile able to hit Israeli cities.Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said that missile tests were no way to signal a desire for peace."If Syria wants peace, the tone and style is not with missiles or weapons like that," Levy told reporters."Israel wants and its strategy is to reach peace. It has passed messages in that direction. We expect that Syria will prove its intention for peace by answering the Israeli message and we will be able to sit and talk peace."Syria meanwhile accused Israel through its official media of beating the drums of war by reneging on peace commitments, "escalating tension and waving flagrant threats against Lebanon and Syria."Zeev Maoz, the head of Israel's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies -- the country's best known think-tank -- said on Sunday the probability of war with Syria had increased with Netanyahu's election. Maoz said Netanyahu's position could push Damascus to try to break a diplomatic stalemate by starting a war.Israeli Channel Two television, which gave no source for the Syria missile test report, said the Scud-C was tested several weeks ago. An Israeli army spokeswoman said she had no knowledge about any Syrian missile tests.A former commander of Israel's air force, Avihu Bin Nun, told Israel's army radio such missile tests were routine. He said Israel was doing part of Syria's work for it by "making a big deal" over missiles it knew Damascus possessed.He added Israel still had the deterrent advantage."They (Syrians) know we can bother them 100 times for every such launch," Bin Nun said.On Monday, during his first visit to Israeli-occupied south Lebanon since his May election victory, Netanyahu warned that pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla group raids on Israeli forces there would only worsen the conflict."It is not good for Syria, Lebanon or Hizbollah or Israel. Therefore our choice is to try to reach a calming of the situation and guaranteeing security for all," Netanyahu said.Israel says Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon where it has 35,000 troops, could curb Hizbollah guerrillas fighting to oust Israel from a 15 km (nine mile) deep south Lebanon buffer strip the Jewish state has held since 1982.Lebanon and Syria have both publicly rejected Netanyahu's "Lebanon First" proposal -- by which Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon for the right security guarantees -- as a ploy to avoid handing the strategic Golan Heights back to Damascus.Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu says he will not relinquish the plateau. Israel's previous government said it was ready to make concessions on the Golan for full peace with Syria.

UK: British burglar roasted during hospital break-in.British burglar roasted during hospital break-in.A British burglar who decided to try for a quick tan after breaking into a hospital nearly roasted to death on a sunbed, a court heard on Tuesday.Owen Crowther, 18, suffered third degree burns on 90 percent of his body after just 15 seconds on the sunbed in Salisbury District Hospital in southern England.After being treated at another local hospital Crowther admitted the burglary."He's very lucky not to have killed himself with that machine," his lawyer Sarah Barnard told the court."He was under it for 15 seconds and 45 seconds causes death. He was in extreme pain when he was caught and in great distress."Salisbury magistrates, who were told the machine used to treat skin complaints was 60 times more powerful than a regular sunbed, ajourned the case after ordering Owens to undergo psychiatric tests.

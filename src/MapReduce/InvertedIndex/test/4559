JAPAN: U.S. navy says its jets tailed Qantas airliner.U.S. navy says its jets tailed Qantas airliner.The United States stepped forward on Tuesday to reveal that two of its fighter jets, not Japanese planes, flew close to a Qantas passenger aircraft off Japan 12 days ago.The acknowledgement came after Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) reported that Qantas flight 22 from Tokyo to Sydney was tailed by Japanese military aircraft off Japan's Pacific coast on August 8."Two U.S. Navy F/A-18 'Hornet' fighter aircraft flew below and came no closer than 1,200 feet to a Qantas Airlines 747 at 11.54 a.m., Aug. 8, 20 miles northeast of Japan's Miyake-jima," the U.S. military command said in a statement released in Tokyo."The 1,200 foot separation is within authorised International Civil Aviation Organisation procedures, and regarded by ICAO standards as both safe and acceptable," the statement said.The two fighter aircraft were flying on the edge of a designated military training area below the Qantas 747, the statement said.ABC radio reported that the pilot on the Qantas aircraft saw on his radar two fighters--which he identified as Japanese planes--tracking the Boeing 747, forcing him to pull the plane into a steep ascent to avoid an incident.Commenting on the report, Japanese air force officials said there was no record of its fighters scrambling or taking emergency steps on that date and that there are no Japanese air force training zones along the route from Tokyo to Sydney.Japan's Ministry of Transportation said it had received a request from its Australian counterpart to investigate what the ministry called the "approach" of two fighters toward the Qantas jet, but said it was unable to confirm the origin of the planes.The Qantas captain filed a report complaining of the intimidating behaviour of the fighter jets, ABC radio said.

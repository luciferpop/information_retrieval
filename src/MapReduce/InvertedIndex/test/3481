The Broken Hill Pty Co ltd, Australia's largest company and the world's number two copper producer, closed four cents down at at A$17.50.The budget put some pressure on the Australian dollar, which some think could push up Australian dollar-denominated gold.Australia's new conservative government on Tuesday unveiled a 1996/97 budget making sweeping spending cuts.Treasurer Peter Costello, announcing a A$5.6 billion underlying deficit for the fiscal year to June 30, 1997, said tough decisions were taken to turn Australia away from "a path to deficit and debt."  The executive director of the Minerals Council of Australia said the council supported the government's medium-term fiscal strategy of a return to an underlying budget surplus."The Coalition government's action will cause some adjustments and pain but as a country australia cannot continue to spend and tax beyond the capacity of the economy to deliver," the council's executive director, David Buckingham, said."This budget helps create a sound basis for sustainable long-term economic growth," Buckingham said in a statement.He said the minerals industry "particularly appreciated" the government's decision to retain the diesel rebate.

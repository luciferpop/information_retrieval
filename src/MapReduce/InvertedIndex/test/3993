UK: WORLD BONDS - Australia lacks allure after budget.WORLD BONDS - Australia lacks allure after budget.Australian bonds rallied happily higher ahead of Tuesday's 1996/7 budget, but after the event, analysts said the market may have overstepped the mark.The budget, the first by a Conservative government after 13 years of Labour rule, pulled on fiscal reigns -- but not quite as hard as had been speculated in financial markets.The upshot is that other dollar-bloc debt may now have more allure than Aussie bonds, analysts said."The initial reaction is a slight sell," said the head of bond research at an Australian bank in London."Growth is at a slightly higher level than people had thought, and the savings set out for achieving a tighter budget deficit seem to be a little bit flexible," he said.Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said government spending would be cut by A$3.9 billion, bringing the underlying budget deficit to A$5.65 billion in the 1996/7 financial year.The average forecast from analysts polled before the budget was for a 1996/7 budegt deficit of A$4.7 billion.Costello and Prime Minister John Howard said the budget paved the way for looser monetary policy.But with gross domestic product data (GDP) on Tuesday showing annual growth at 4.5 percent in June, analysts were sceptical of further easing prospects."It is often the case when finance ministers have to present restrictive budgets that they promise rate cuts as a reward for those who have to bear the pain," said Stephen Lewis, director of research at London Bond Broking.The Reserve Bank of Australia suprised financial markets on July 31 with a 50 basis point cut in it official cash rate to 7.00 percent -- its first monetary easing for three years."Whether we actually get more cuts will depend on the course the economy takes -- and if we get numbers as strong as today's GDP, the pace at which rates can fall may be quite gradual," Lewis said.Against the budget and growth background, analysts said international investors had little to get excited about in Australian debt, saying Aussie yield spreads against the U.S. were likely to widen.The 10-year Auusie/U.S. yield spread was 134 basis points just before Costello's budget, but analysts said they would not be surprised to see it at 150 before the week is out.Yields on the benchmark 10-year Aussie bond rose around eight basis points after the budget was presented.Further out, the comparative weakening trend will continue, analysts said. "We could well see that spread in the 175 to 180 basis points area in the next six months," said LBB's Lewis.David Crofts, international bond salesman at Williams de Broe in London, said he would be looking for a 10-year spread nearer to 200 points before Aussie bonds showed real value."I would tend to be looking to sell Australia into the U.S. or Canada," he said. "The Aussie/U.S. spread is historically narrow at the moment -- something nearer to 200 basis points against the U.S. would be better value."Crofts said the budget package showed Australia's government was going for growth, and although interest rate cuts may help the short end, the risk of easings hitting the currency would leave longer-dated paper vulnerable.With subdued growth and minimal price pressures, Canada offered one of the most attractive fundamental backgrounds of the dollar-bloc markets, both Crofts and Lewis said."I would favour Canada among the lot," said Lewis. "They are making solid progess towards meeting fiscal targets, the economy is still quite subdued and inflation is only 1.2 percent anyway -- and on a falling trend. That is all very constructive for Canadian bonds."-- Kate Kelland, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682

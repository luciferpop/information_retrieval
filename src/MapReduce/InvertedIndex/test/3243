BULGARIA: Bulgaria lev closes firmer at 198.60/80 per dollar.Bulgaria lev closes firmer at 198.60/80 per dollar.The Bulgarian lev closed at 198.60/80 per dollar, a touch firmer than a midday low of 198.80/00 due to a slight rise of foreign currency supply but still softer than the opening at 198.00/50, dealers said.The lev weakened to 199-200 per dollar in late morning trade after dollar supply dwindled on expectations of a fresh lev fall.Banks were bidding for foreign currency mostly on behalf of big clients, which dealers said sought large dollar volumes.Some dealers said the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) might have offered foreign currency in the afternoon to halt the lev decline but central bank officials said the BNB had not appeared in the market Tuesday.Other dealers said a large state bank had offered dollars to the market in the afternoon to support the lev ahead of the visit of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission due to begin on Wednesday.Maintaining a steady exchange rate is a major item in the tough reform programme, which Bulgaria pledged to fulfil under a funding agreement with the IMF approved in July. -- Dessislava Popova, Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 981 8569

UKRAINE: Ukraine denies Taiwan vice-president visiting.Ukraine denies Taiwan vice-president visiting.The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry denied on Tuesday a report by Taiwanese television that Vice-President Lien Chan's secretive journey was taking him to the former Soviet republic."We have no information at all on this visit. There is no visit," Valentyn Adomaitis, head of the ministry's Asia-Pacific department, told Reuters. "Our policy towards Taiwan is clear -- it's part of China. We have no official ties with Taipei and we have always strongly followed this line."Taiwan Television had reported that after ending a visit to the United States Lien Chan made a brief stopover in Vienna and then flew to the Ukrainian capital.The broadcast, which gave no source for the information, followed a flurry of rumours that Lien had arrived in various European nations.China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel province ineligible for foreign ties and has sought to isolate it diplomatically since a civil war separated them in 1949.Adomaitis said Ukraine maintains only economic relations with Taiwan with no political or diplomatic ties. Ukrainian and Chinese leaders signed a joint declaration two years ago stressing that Kiev recognises "a single China" policy."I cannot exclude that Taiwan's leader might make a brief transit stopover in Ukraine but we also have no information on that," Adomaitis said by telephone. "We do not follow the leaders of states with whom we have no relations."Ukraine views China as one of its most important trading partners, with annual bilateral trade volume of almost $1 billion.Several Ukrainian politicians have visited Taiwan since Kiev gained independence from Moscow five years ago but Ukraine has only recently started considering allowing the presence of a Taiwanese trade mission, a move tolerated by China.

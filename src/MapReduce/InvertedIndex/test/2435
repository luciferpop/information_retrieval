SINGAPORE: Raised bid to ensure Transmarco takeover.Raised bid to ensure Transmarco takeover.Indonesian tobacco tycoon Putera Sampoerna sharply raised on Tuesday his offer for Singapore's Transmarco Ltd as its share price surged, a move which dealers said was likely to make the bid successful.Standard Chartered Merchant Bank Asia said on Tuesday that Miel Investment Corp, wholly owned by Sampoerna, had raised its takeover offer for Transmarco to Singapore $8.55 per share from S$6.50 bid at the weekend.Transmarco, a trading and telecommunications firm, had suspended its share trading in mid-afternoon on Tuesday pending the announcement."It looks like Sampoerna is serious. I think he will be able to get more than 51 percent. Sukamto is likely to sell most of his stake to him as he might not be able to unload that much in the market," one head of institutional sales at a local brokerage told Reuters.Indonesian-born Sukamto Sia garnered 55 percent of the company with a bid of S$6.50 per share in late 1994. He later stepped down as chairman and director and has since reduced his stake to 36.2 percent.

Traders said this was within market expectations.  Key December three-month Euroyen futures on TIFFE stood at 99.16 as of 0249 GMT, down from Monday's 99.19."The December Euroyen futures' slight weakness is due to concern about the current high level of prices," a trader for a second city bank said.Lingering concern about a possible interest rate rise at Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is also discouraging further buying, the trader said."Most traders think neither the FOMC nor the BOJ will raise rates soon. But there is still some concern about the possibility," he said. -- Masayuki Kitano, (81-3-5473-3748)

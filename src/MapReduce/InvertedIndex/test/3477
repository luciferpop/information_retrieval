George also criticised the government's family assistance programme, describing the tax breaks as poorly targeted. "The greatest benefit will go to those most well off," she said.She welcomed in principle the budget announcement of a tax surcharge on the retirement savings of high-income earners, but said wealthy people could avoid this by putting their savings into the superannuation funds of their non-working spouse."I think the hardest hit are the people with the greatest need in our community," she said.Australia's unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent in July, according to the latest official figures.  -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

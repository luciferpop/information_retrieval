POLAND: POLISH JULY EARNINGS JUST UP AFTER WEAK FIRST HALF.POLISH JULY EARNINGS JUST UP AFTER WEAK FIRST HALF.Firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange recorded slightly better July earnings after a weak first half, but analysts said it was too early to tell if there would be an earnings rebound this year.In July 48 firms on the main and parallel markets showed a real net profit growth year-on-year compared with 34 firms over the first six months."July earnings were average, but better than the weak results recorded in May and June, so they're returning to normal rather than worsening," said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment.Analysts had attributed this year's long winter to lower profits over the year's first four months.But they said unspectacular May and June earnings hastened a downward correction that followed the main market's 90- percent rise this year to a 27-month high of 14,282.2 points on July 5.Analysts had expected one more growth spurt but instead a 14-percent downtrend and then stability followed until last week when investors started buying in hopes of better earnings.But analysts said many players, especially foreign investors, would need preliminary third-quarter results due in October to be sure profits had taken a bullish turn.Jacek Dzierwa, Polish equity analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, said better July earnings were a good sign but nothing definite, as Polish auditors were likely to find losses previously overlooked."I'm taking those monthly results as an indication, but nothing tangible," Dzierwa said.Firms showing good results tended to rise on the bourse on Tuesday, such as top gainer PPABank , up by the daily maximum 10 percent.But analysts said the July results were not likely strong enough to maintain the WIG's recent four-session, six-percent jump to Tuesday's close at 13,183.8 points.Among individual firms Swarzedz disappointed recording a loss despite improved sales, they said.They said paint makers Polifarb Wroclaw and especially Polifarb Cieszyn looked particularily strong even though better earnings were expected due to a seasonal surge in sales.Raiffeisen's Tarnowski said Cieszyn recorded its best monthly result in history.-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

USA: Ill. senator defends Nigeria trip; denies office rift.Ill. senator defends Nigeria trip; denies office rift.U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun on Tuesday defended her recent trip to Nigeria against criticism from human rights groups, and denied that the affair had caused her chief of staff to resign.The Illinois Democrat, the only black in the U.S. Senate, said her visit was "a private trip and certainly no secret."She told a news conference that U.S. policy toward Nigeria's army ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, has not been fair or even-handed and it was her duty as a senator to maintain a dialogue with him.She also said she had a personal friendship with Abacha's wife and had known her son, Ibrahim, who was blown up in an airplane six months ago.The Chicago Sun-Times reported on Friday that Moseley-Braun's chief of staff, Edie Wilson -- the third person to hold that post since she was elected to the Senate nearly four years ago -- had resigned because she had not been told of the Nigeria trip."My private staff was aware of my whereabouts," Moseley-Braun said, adding that the trip was a private vacation. She said Wilson had agreed to depart before the trip, and released a letter from her saying "we mutually concluded that it would be best to go our separate ways."Amnesty International issued a statement last week calling the trip inappropriate and branding Nigeria "a major human rights violator." Randall Robinson, head of the African lobbying group TransAfrica, called her visit deeply troubling.Nigeria's military rulers have been under international scrutiny for rights abuses since last November when nine minority rights activists were hanged for murder.The West African state has been in turmoil since 1993 when it annulled a presidential vote to restore democracy. Since then, many people have been detained including the presumed winner of that plebiscite, Moshood Abiola, as well as pro-democracy activists and journalists.

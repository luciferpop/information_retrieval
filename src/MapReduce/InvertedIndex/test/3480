AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian farmers support basis of budget.RTRS-Australian farmers support basis of budget.Australia's National Farmers' Federation (NFF) was encouraged by the Federal government's commitment to achieve a balance in the underlying budget over the economic cycle, NFF president Donald McGauchie said.The benefits to agriculture and to the economic community generally from tough budget measures were already apparent in recent reductions in short and long-term interest rates, he said in a statement.Treasurer Peter Costello earlier handed down a budget with a A$5.65 billion underlying deficit for fiscal 1996/97 to June 30.  The NFF welcomed retention of the diesel fuel rebate and of matching funding for research and development corporations, increased funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the A$3.4 million commitment to the "Supermarket to Asia" food export strategy, he said.NFF was also pleased that core funding for landcare programmes would be increased.However, it was disappointed most of the funds earmarked for the National Vegetation Initiative and the Murray Darling Basin initiative would be delayed pending the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunications group, Telstra Corp, he said.  NFF also regretted the decision to reduce funding for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corp by A$5 million and the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corp by A$1 million.A A$25.6 million cut from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service between 1996/97 and 1999/2000 for community service obligations while quarantine was under review and the ten percent a year cut in the Citrus Market Diversification Programme would not help the rural sector, he said.  Graham Dalton, executive director of the Queensland Farmers' Federation (QFF), told Reuters the Australian national budget on balance was good for the farm sector because a hard-nosed budget was necessary for the wider economy,"A good budget for the farm sector is one that gets the Australian economy moving," he said."Although there's no real handouts for farmers in this budget, it was a necessary budget," he said.It had the appearance of a tough budget which spread the burden of fiscal reform across much of the community, he said.  The farm sector welcomed confirmation that the diesel fuel rebate was largely unchanged, he said.Some of the important farm measures would be dependent on the sale of one-third of Telstra Corp. QFF would want to work through the fine print, he said.The disposal of Telstra, cuts to universities and Aboriginal expenditure were hard messages for Australia, but the government did not have many options, he said.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

BRAZIL: Brazil GDP to grow 5-6 pct in second half - Ipea. [CORRECTED 15:55 GMT]Brazil GDP to grow 5-6 pct in second half - Ipea. [CORRECTED 15:55 GMT]Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) should grow by between 5.0 and 6.0 percent in the second half of 1996 compared with the same period of 1995, a director of the government's Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea) said.That figure, after virtually zero growth in the first half of the year, would confirm Ipea's forecasts of GDP growth of between 2.8 and 3.0 percent for 1996 as a whole, Claudio Considera, Ipea Research director said.  Considera said GDP growth in the second quarter of 1996 totalled 184 billion (corrects from 1.84 billion) reais, a record for that quarter, and he forecasted GDP for the year would be 600 billion reais.Contributing to the second quarter's performance was a 10 percent boost in industrial output in July compared with the same month last year, he said.He also cited growth in the number of salaries paid and the real value of salaries, and a pick-up in the construction industry linked to October and November municipal elections.-- William Schomberg, Brasilia newsroom, 55-61-2230358

MEXICO: Mexico to stand by steel import tariffs - ministry.Mexico to stand by steel import tariffs - ministry.Mexico's Trade Ministry said Tuesday the government had decided to stand by a 1993 decision to impose compensatory import tariffs on hot and cold rolled steel plate imports.The ministry said requests to revise the tariffs did not succeed. "In both cases, the ministry considered that the companies that asked for the revisions did not supply sufficient proof...that allowed for a change in the imposed tariffs," it said.The ministry confirmed that the current tariffs, first set April 28, 1993 after dumping allegations against U.S. companies, remained in place. They are 28.2-28.7 percent for hot-rolled and 12.8 percent for cold rolled.--Chris Aspin, Mexico City newsroom (525) 7289530.

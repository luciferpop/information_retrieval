AUSTRALIA: Protests continue on eve of Australian budget.Protests continue on eve of Australian budget.Australia's new conservative government said it would hand down a "fair" budget on Tuesday night, but budget opponents rallied for a second day outside parliament, the scene of a riot the day before.The five-month-old Liberal-National government was to announce its budget to June 30, 1997 at 0930 GMT. The budget will be its first and the first for a conservative Australian government in 14 years."It's going to be a fair budget, and we are looking forward to putting in place the measures that will help families and small businesses and get Australia moving," Treasurer Peter Costello told reporters on Tuesday morning.The government has promised to cut A$4.0 billion (US$3.0 billion) from its maiden budget in a tough fiscal programme aimed at achieving a budget surplus within three years. The budget deficit for 1995/96 was A$10.3 billion.But the sharp spending cuts already announced have provoked angry protests across Australia from workers, students, Aborigines and welfare groups.Monday's riot outside parliament house began during a rally in the capital by up to 15,000 unionists, aborigines, students, welfare and other community groups.Police in riot gear fought for two hours to control hundreds of protesters who stormed the foyer of Parliament House.Aboriginal organisers of Tuesday's protest have promised a peaceful rally. About 600 Aborigines gathered for an overnight protest on the lawns of old parliament house.The government has announced funding cuts of A$400 million for indigenous people over the next four years.Financial markets are concerned about Australia's chronic national savings and external debt problems and are counting on Costello slashing the budget deficit, hopefully by more than the forecast A$4.0 billion.Canberra, committed to no extra tax revenue, has already announced big spending cuts in aboriginal affairs, higher education and programmes to help the jobless find work.Ideally, markets want a bottom-line underlying deficit of at most A$5.0 billion, half the 1995/96 shortfall. The underlying deficit excludes one-off items such as asset sales.(A$1 = US$0.78)

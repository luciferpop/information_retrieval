UK: Brazil buying of Europe oil products up in August.Brazil buying of Europe oil products up in August.Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has ramped up its purchases of gas oil and naphtha in August, and traders said it was because of a combination of surging demand and refinery maintenance programmes.European traders expect Petrobras to have lifted more than 200,000 tonnes of 0.3-0.5 percent sulphur gas oil from the Mediterranean in August, in addition to its 75,000-tonne term contract with Italian refiner Isab.This compares with a total 700,000 tonnes of gas oil imports from the Mediterranean over the whole of last year, traders said.In addition, around 150,000 tonnes of August-loading naphtha is thought to have been sold to Brazil out of Europe. Yearly comparisons were not immediately available, but these quantities were thought to be unusually high.Traders said maintenance at Brazilian refineries in August, most notably at the 250,000 barrels per day Sao Paulo plant, was the reason for the sudden shortage of naphtha.Officials at Petrobras in London declined to comment on their purchases or on Brazilian refinery activities.An Italian refiner, commenting on the gas oil purchases, said: "(Brazil) is experiencing very fast economic growth...The main demand (for gas oil) is coming from the transportation sector."Traders reckon demand for imported gas oil could reach 400,000 tonnes a month over the rest of the year, with most of the product sourced from the Mediterranean."It seems that the Med is the best area to buy from. It works out best in terms of freight rates because we can load big vessels," the refiner said."And it has worked for us since the arb to the Far East is now closed most of the time."The only question mark hanging over the fast-growing gas oil trade is the introduction of low sulphur (0.05 percent) diesel as the standard diesel grade across the European Union from October 1.A wide price differential between grades could make the trade with Brazil uneconomic, traders said."If the price (for the low sulphur product) is good, we may lose interest in selling the poorer gas oil," said the refiner.--Rosalind Russell, Nicholas Shaxson, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5387

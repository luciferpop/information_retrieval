HAITI: Preval visits scene of attack on Haitian police.Preval visits scene of attack on Haitian police.Haitian President Rene Preval on Tuesday visited the Port-au-Prince police station, the scene of a Monday morning attack by unidentified men wearing military uniforms."There was shooting near the residence of (former President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide as well," Preval said.Police officers at the station said things were returning to normal after an attack by some 20 men in military fatigues. The men threw grenades and fired automatic weapons, killing a shoeshine worker who was caught in the crossfire."Everyone has calmed down, although now we are increasing security," said one officer who works at the station."We are increasing all our patrols and investigating to determine who was responsible," police spokesman Felder Jean-Baptiste told a news conference on Monday night.He said the attackers dressed like the former military and wielded heavy weapons but he could not say who they were as they had all escaped.The Haitian military was disbanded by Aristide in January, 1995, shortly after he was restored to power by U.S. troops. He was ousted in 1991 in a bloody military coup.The Haitian National Police replaced the military as the nation's security force. Former soldiers have been marching in the capital, angry that they no longer receive a paycheck.Police initially said Monday's attack on the police station lasted about an hour but have since trimmed that estimate. Jean-Baptiste said the attack lasted half an hour, U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said it lasted fifteen minutes, and local newspapers have reported that it raged for five minutes.

AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Australia to boost private health insurance.RTRS - Australia to boost private health insurance.The Australian government on Tuesday announced tax incentives worth about A$500 million a year to encourage people to take out private health insurance and to wean rich people off the public Medicare health system.Treasurer Peter Costello, handing down the 1996/97 (July/June) budget here, also announced a one percent rise in the Medicare income levy for people who earn over A$50,000 a year and who do not take out private health insurance.The budget papers show the Medicare surcharge is forecast to raise A$60 million in 1998/99 and A$75 million in 1999/2000.  But this will be offset by the cost of rebates for people who are privately insured -- forecast at an extra A$489 million in outlays in 1998/99, the incentive scheme's first full year."Medicare will remain, bulk billing is unchanged. But people will be given greater choice to take out private health insurance," Costello told parliament in his budget speech."This will stem the declining rate of health insurance and secure the funding of our health system."The government also announced a costs review aimed at saving A$586 million over four years from subsidised pathology services, including diagnostic imaging.  "The government will work with the pathology industry to slow the unsustainable growth in pathology outlays under the Medical Benefits Scheme," Costello said.The government will also stop funding the national dental programme, saving over A$100 million a year from 1997/98, and adjust childcare subsidies to save about A$35 million in 1997/98.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

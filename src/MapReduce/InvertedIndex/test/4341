GERMANY: German wheat prices under pressure from harvest.German wheat prices under pressure from harvest.German wheat prices are poised for further falls as the harvest makes progress across the country, brokers said on Tuesday.The exception was the north, where some crops had not finished ripening and would take another eight to 10 days, although the weather was now dry and sunny."Buyers and sellers can't agree as buyers point to good harvests elsewhere in Europe and to early indications of good German yields and protein contents," one said."Sellers hope for Eastern European and North African demand and won't lower their quality wheat prices," he added.The Hamburg grain exchange maintained its new crop bread wheat price (12.5 percent, 220 hagberg) at 282.50 marks.This is 7.50 marks down from the start of the month.Brokers said ex-farm bread wheat prices across the country of around 270-290 marks should be poised for further falls.This would be especially the case in western regions, where French producers were marketing output that they could not sell abroad under restrictive EU export policies.Feed wheat free Hamburg was lowered to 277.50 marks by the exchange, having shed five marks so far in August.Brokers said local supplies could not compete with British and Danish offers at 265 marks cif northern Germany Aug/Sept.But the local price of first-half 1997 feed wheat at 280 marks was below British offers at 282.Fob Baltic prices of bread wheat for September-November delivery (250 hagberg) were in a 277.50-307.50 marks range, depending on lot size and protein content.Brokers hoped high protein (13-14 percent) wheat at 300 marks and more would be marketeable in Spain, France and Britain, where 11-12 percent is more typical and where blending material is needed to achieve baking qualities.Poland and Hungary suffered crop losses in the harsh 1995/96 winter and would also need to buy in quality wheat.Farm union DBV will issue a new harvest report on Wednesday, and this should offer clues to the impact of weather disruptions to grain harvests earlier this month.--Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom +49-40-41903275

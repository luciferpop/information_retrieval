AUSTRALIA: Australia budget aims to set path for prosperity.Australia budget aims to set path for prosperity.Aborigines burnt an Australian flag in front of parliament house on Tuesday as Treasurer Peter Costello, inside, declared his budget an historic opportunity to to set Australia on the path to economic prosperity,Hundreds of other Aborigines staged rallies in Brisbane and Adelaide against already announced cuts to indigenous funding in the 1996/97 budget, which Costello formally unveiled on Tuesday.Announcing a A$5.6 billion (US$4.4 billion) underlying deficit for the fiscal year to June 30, 1997, Costello defended the cuts, saying the Liberal-National government had taken the tough decisions needed to turn Australia away from "a path to deficit and debt" in its first budget."This is the once-in-the-term, once-in-the-decade opportunity to get it right," he told reporters.The budget slashed A$3.9 billion from hundreds of government programmes, but centred largely on aboriginal affairs, universities and schemes to help the jobless find work.The spending cuts, many of which had been announced ahead of the budget, have sparked widespread protests around the country and triggered rioting at parliament house here on Monday.There were more protests on Tuesday as aboriginal groups and unionists continued to vent their anger.Costello said the cuts, to be followed by similar reductions next year, would attack Australia's chronic underlying budget deficit and burgeoning debt. The underlying measure excludes revenue windfalls such as asset sales."(Without the cuts) debt would be increasing and Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook or sentiment," Costello said in his budget speech.But he also honoured key campaign promises that helped the Liberal-National coalition oust Labor in a landslide March election win, implementing A$1 billion in tax breaks for low and middle income families, more money for the elderly and a range of programmes and tax changes to help small business."This budget implements the key election commitments of the coalition and it does so as part of a responsible economic strategy," Costello told parliament.The budget, the first by a conservative government after 13 years of Labor rule, does little to address Australia's high unemployment, which is forecast to remain at 8.5 percent.The Labor opposition and minor parties have threatened to block budget measures in parliament's upper house, the Senate, where the government does not have a majority.But Costello warned an obstructionist Senate would jeorpardise the economic turnaround."The Senate could knock this budget around. But if it does, it's knocking around our future," he told reporters."If we hadn't taken measures in this budget, which are designed over two years to reduce the underlying bottom line by A$7.2 billion, Australia would have been on a path to deficit and debt to the year 2000."The projected A$5.6 billion underlying deficit is less than half the A$10.3 billion shortfall in 1995/96. The 1996/97 headline result, which takes all figures into account, is a A$474 million surplus.Costello said the budget measures were aimed at cementing sustainable economic growth, reducing debt, boosting national savings and creating jobs.The budget papers gave an optimistic outlook for the Australian economy, with growth forecast at 3.5 percent in 1996/97, against 4.1 percent in 1995/96.Inflation is seen falling to two percent from 4.2 percent and unemployment is projected to remain steady at 8.5 percent.About 150 Aborigines attacked police with bricks, bottles and stakes during a 20-minute confrontation at the old parliament house.One policewoman was repeatedly kicked and has been taken to hospital in a serious condition, a police spokeswoman said.(A$1 = US$0.79)

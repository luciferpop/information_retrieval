FRANCE: RALLYING-MCRAE FINED $250,000 BUT ESCAPES BAN.RALLYING-MCRAE FINED $250,000 BUT ESCAPES BAN.World champion Colin McRae escaped a ban on Tuesday but was fined $250,000, most of it suspended, after breaking new rules in last month's Argentine Rally and colliding with spectators. Five fans were slightly injured.Motor sport's world governing body FIA decided against suspending the Scot and he will only have to pay $75,000 unless he repeats the offence."This was a situation where normally there would be a one or two race suspension," FIA president Max Mosley said after a FIA world council meeting attended by McRae."But he was the first person to fall foul of the new regulations and the world council has taken a lenient view and hopes it won't happen again in the future."We listened to everything (McRae had to say) and he had a lot of extenuating circumstances, there were lots of spectators in the service area and he had lost a lot of time with repairs and was in a great hurry."McRae exceeded the new 50 kph speed limit in a service area and also failed to follow the correct route to the next time control. Mosley said McRae had apologised and admitted to driving too fast in the service area. "We thought it excessive to take him out of one or more events," Mosley said.He said, however, that the service area "is a place for spectators to hang around", where they are allowed to wander among the cars and competitors and FIA would continue to seek strict adherence to its safety regulations.McRae, looking relieved at the outcome of the meeting, said: "I feel very well, very positive that the penalty was a fine and there was no suspension."Security is a big, big issue and we will have to work together to ensure safety is increased as much as possible."Now I can go to the 1,000 Lakes and get on with racing," the 28-year-old added.The sixth round of the world championship in Finland takes place this weekend.After the fifth round in Argentina, Finn Tommi Makkinen leads the championship standings with Spaniard Carlos Sainz in second place, Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson third and McRae fourth.  David Richards, director of McRae's Subaru team, said: "While this incident has placed considerable pressure on him, I for one share his confidence that only good can come from raising the awareness of this issue."

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: INTERVIEW-Kerry aims for 90 pct gearing at end-96.INTERVIEW-Kerry aims for 90 pct gearing at end-96.Irish food company Kerry Group Plc said on Tuesday that it had revised its end-year gearing target up to 90 percent from 70 percent following the acquisition in February of specialist fruit ingredients business Ciprial.Kerry is aiming to cut its net debt to 328 million Irish pounds at end-1996 from 372 million at the half-year stage, a company spokesman told Reuters.The group's debt-equity ratio, which soared to 120 percent following the $402 million acquisition of DCA Food Industries in late 1994, fell to 95 percent at end-1995.  But it rose to 108 percent by June 30, 1996, mainly due to the 54 million punt purchase of Ciprial and the acquisition of the remaining equity in a joint venture between Solutech and DCA in Australia."In the aftermath of the DCA acquisition we said we would take out 100 million Irish pound debt within a two-year period. We were well on target to do that," the spokesman said."Having bought Ciprial and with the Australian business, that increased our requirement by 59 million Irish pounds. So our revised target for the end of 1996 is 328 million punts," he added.

USA: Gingrich touts welfare reform but gets complaints.Gingrich touts welfare reform but gets complaints.House Speaker Newt Gingrich used a community learning centre as a backdrop to voice support for welfare reform on Tuesday but found himself fielding complaints about the program's finances.The Georgia Republican signed a letter urging President Clinton to approve sweeping welfare reform legislation that would end the 61-year-old federal guarantee of aid to the poor and delegate broad powers to states.President Clinton announced earlier this month he intended to sign the legislation into law this week.The learning centre, called Coach's Corner Project Light, was based in an old school building converted into a multipurpose community centre for a 56-year-old federal housing project in this largely affluent Atlanta suburb.Programme founder Bobby Lankford, a former NFL coach, said the centre used computer-based teaching to tutor about 40 neighbourhood children in reading and basic language skills.A $35,000 U.S. housing grant purchased the center's computers, tutorial software and computer training for a largely volunteer staff. But Lankford said its $60,000 annual operating budget consisted entirely of private donations from churches, civic groups, foundations and other sources.Gingrich extolled the virtues of community-based learning as an alternative to federal assistance, but a staff member, administrative assistant Verona Martin, interrupted him to complain the center's director had not been paid and it had no budget."We're talking about teaching the kids, that's what we're here for. We're talking about doing it for the community. I think we should first pay the director. She has not had a penny," said Verona Martin, who described herself as an administrative assistant at the centre."We don't have a budget. We don't have stuff in here that the kids need," she said."I don't run the programme. I'm just here because I think it's a good concept," Gingrich responded.Lankford denied the woman's allegations, saying the centre did not owe anyone anything. A Gingrich spokesman later described Martin as a friend of a former centre director who resigned in June.

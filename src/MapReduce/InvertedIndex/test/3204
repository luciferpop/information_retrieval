BOSNIA: Karadzic posters removed in Zvornik - Bildt.Karadzic posters removed in Zvornik - Bildt.The Bosnian Serb nationalist SDS party in Zvornik has heeded a warning to remove campaign posters featuring Radovan Karadzic or risk disqualification from upcoming elections, international mediator Carl Bildt said on Tuesday."European Community monitors surveyed the town and reported back to me that they found only one Karadzic poster in a public place on a garage wall near the local hospital," Bildt told Reuters on Tuesday.Bildt met the mayor and local SDS party chief in Zvornik on Saturday and threatened election penalties if posters he saw along the main street were not removed by Monday."It looks as if the warning has had an effect, which is good. Let's hope that it lasts," Bildt said."I have also written to the SDS leadership indicating that I have yet to see an SDS poster anywhere without Karadzic's face on it."Radovan Karadzic, twice indicted for war crimes, served as president of both Bosnia's Serb Republic and the SDS until international political pressure forced him from both offices last month.The Dayton peace accord which ended Bosnia's 43-month conflict prohibits people indicted for war crimes from holding public office or playing any role in the elections scheduled for September 14.But in the run-up to the poll, posters with Karadzic's name and face have been appearing in public, much to the consternation of the international community, for whom Bildt is High Representative in Bosnia.Zvornik, 80 km (50 miles) northeast of Sarajevo, once had a majority Moslem population but is inhabited by Serbs.

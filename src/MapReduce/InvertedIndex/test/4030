YEMEN: Eritrea to remove troops from disputed island.Eritrea to remove troops from disputed island.Yemen said on Tuesday that France had assured it that Eritrea would pull out troops from a disputed Red Sea island by Friday at the latest."French envoy Francis Gutman told me that Eritrea will withdraw from the (Lesser Hanish) island next Friday as a maximum date," Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh told a group of judges.France said on Monday that Eritrea had agreed to withdraw its forces from the island, cooling a dispute with Yemen that had threatened to derail an arbitration accord between the two Red Sea states signed in Paris in May."Eritrea is going to withdraw from this island. In this way the arbitration procedure intended to peacefully resolve the two nations' differences can now proceed normally," a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.There has been no confirmation from Eritrea of the decision.Yemen earlier threatened to take military action against Eritrea if mediation failed to defuse the crisis triggered by its sending troops to the island earlier this month.Both states claim islands, which lie near tanker routes at the Red Sea's southern entrance, and fought briefly over them last December.

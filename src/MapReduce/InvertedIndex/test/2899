USA: Chile's ENAP seeks more Oct crude in thin market.Chile's ENAP seeks more Oct crude in thin market.Chile's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (ENAP) has issued another buy tender for October crude oil, attempting to secure supplies in a thin market, traders said on Tuesday.The new tender asks for 960,000 barrels of crude to be delivered during October 15-18, and closes on Thursday.ENAP last week purchased 380,000 barrels of Ecuadorian Oriente from a trader at a price around Ecuador's sales formula plus five cents (fob), with an option for a second cargo."They are probably still trying to secure intermediate West African crudes, and at a better price," a trader said, noting prior offers may not have been at competitive prices.ENAP recently bought crudes from Gabon, Angola and Nigeria, but expensive premiums and costly freight have proved prohibitive, while regional supplies have also been thin.--Jacqueline Wong, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620

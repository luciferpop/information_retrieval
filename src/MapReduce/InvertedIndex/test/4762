INDONESIA: Indonesia military pledges to end Irian kidnapping.Indonesia military pledges to end Irian kidnapping.Indonesia's military has pledged to rescue 13 forestry company workers held hostage in remote Irian Jaya province, the official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday."We will move to rescue them before long," army chief General Hartono was quoted as saying on Monday.The hostages are employees of concessionaire PT Kamundan Raya, a subsidiary of the Djajanti Group. They were kidnapped last Wednesday when their base camp 60 km (37 miles) west of the town of Timika was attacked by a group of Irianese.Timika is about 4,000 km (2,500 miles) east of Jakarta.Hartono said the military thought the hostage-takers were criminals and not seperatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) rebels.Antara gave no other details. Military officials in Irian Jaya said they had located the area where the hostages were being held and were ready to free them.The kidnappers have sent sent three demands to the military in Irian Jaya: cessation of all logging; appointment of tribal leader Tom Beanal as a mediator; and the involvement of a human rights organisation in negotiations.Beanal, an environmental activist, told Reuters from Timika, that he had not received the demand."Everything regarding this kidnapping is still vague. I don't have much idea of what's going on, so I think I don't want to get involved," he said by telephone.Indonesia faces limited resistance to its rule in Irian, a former Dutch colony it seized in 1963, especially from the OPM.The OPM held 11 hostages, including five Europeans, for more than four months to publicise its fight for a free Irian Jaya.In May, four British, two Dutch and three Indonesian hostages held by the OPM escaped after the army tried to rescue them. Two Indonesian hostages were killed by their captors.

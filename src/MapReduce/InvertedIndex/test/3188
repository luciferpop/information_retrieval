RUSSIA: Russians deny rebel charge troops killed refugees.Russians deny rebel charge troops killed refugees.Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said on Tuesday Russian troops blew up a bridge by which refugees were trying to flee the capital Grozny, killing about 100 civilians, but Russian officials denied the allegation.Interfax news agency quoted the federal forces' prosecutor's office in Chechnya as saying it knew nothing of the alleged attack. "If this happened, we would definitely have been told," it quoted a spokesman as saying.Udugov accused troops of blowing up the bridge and then shooting at civilians. "Today around 3.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) several hundred refugees were crossing a bridge near the Kirova settlement towards the village of Alkhan-Yurt," he told Reuters by telephone."When they were crossing the bridge Russian servicemen blew it up. Around 100 refugees, mainly women and children, died."Some of the refugees who managed to cross the bridge were seized by the Russian servicemen and shot dead on the spot. Some 6,000 refugees were forced to flee back to Grozny," he added.There was no way to check the report independently, and Interfax said the military administration in Chechnya did not confirm it. Alkhan-Yurt is a few km (miles) southwest of Grozny.Udugov said the Chechen leadership had issued a statement blaming the acting head of troops in Chechnya, Konstantin Pulikovsky."It said General Pulikovsky will carry personal responsibility for this before the whole Chechen people no matter how long it takes," he said."It also appealed to the so-called international community which propagates human rights to find some way to react to this bloody crime and reject this policy of double standards."

GERMANY: INSTANT VIEW - German July M3 data.INSTANT VIEW - German July M3 data.Following is a selection of economists' reactions to German July M3 money supply data which showed annualised, seasonally-adjusted M3 growth of 8.6 percent in July versus 9.6 percent in June.Economists polled by Reuters had predicted M3 growth of 8.8 percent on average.UWE ANGENENDT, BHF-BANK"Monetary expansion has slowed considerably. This is a very good sign for the Bundesbank on Thursday. I expect a repo rate cut of 10 to 20 basis points."  ULRICH BECKMANN, DB RESEARCH:"It was at the lower end of our expectation, which was 8.6 to 9.1 percent. It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate. We expect the Ifo business climate index to rise, but not by such rate that would put off cutting the rate. We would need to see a very sharp rebound to about 93 or 94 (from 90.4 in June). But even then I would not see this as such a good figure to stop a cut."NICK STAMENKOVIC, SBK INTERNATIONAL:"Today's figures have certainly increased the chance for a move. (Bundesbank chief economist) Issing hinted at the increased chance for a move last week. I think on balance they will cut the repo rate."SVEN OEHL, BZW, FRANKFURT:"Bunds ticked up right after the number but fell down to almost an unchanged level. It was what the market was looking for. It was pretty much a neutral figure. I think a repo rate cut has definitely been factored into the market considering the Euromark contracts. We are waiting to see the final cut. If we do not get it this week, we will look to the next meeting. It would become an ongoing game."--Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

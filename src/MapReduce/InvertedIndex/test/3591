"They ran themselves. We did not expel them."Nagai said embassy guards had seen the two men outside the compound earlier with two companions.In November, 21 East Timorese broke into the Japanese embassy compound and left a day later for asylum in Portugal.Following the incident, the embassy added an extra layer of barbed wire to the metal fence.Since September last year 84 East Timorese have left for Portugal after seeking asylum in foreign embassies in Jakarta.Portugal is the former colonial ruler of East Timor, a small enclave north of Australia invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and unilaterally annexed the following year.The United Nations does not recognise Indonesia's rule in East Timor and regards Lisbon as the administering power.

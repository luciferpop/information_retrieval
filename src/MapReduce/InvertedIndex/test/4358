BELGIUM: Belgian child rapist terrifies own sister.Belgian child rapist terrifies own sister.The family of Marc Dutroux, main suspect in a Belgian child sex scandal, said on Tuesday they had begged the authorities to keep him in prison longer after his 1989 convictions for rape."It was known that he was a sick man," sister Valerie Dutroux told Belgium's VTM television. "To me he is no longer human. I was scared to death by him."She said their parents had opposed Marc's early release and had "begged" authorities to keep him in jail.Dutroux's mother Jeanine told De Morgen newspaper: "Just like the parents of Julie and Melissa, I cannot understand how they could have released him after what became clear in 1989."Dutroux, a 39-year-old father of three, led police to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, who had died of starvation early this year after being kidnapped in June 1995.He has been charged with kidnapping Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, has admitted abducting An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks and is suspected of involvement in several other disappearances.There was a national outcry when it was revealed that Dutroux was a convicted child sex offender who had been released 10 years early in 1992 from a 13-year jail sentence.Valerie, who has a three-year-old son, said she had chosen a school surrounded by walls to help protect her own child.Marc Dutroux, described by neighbours as a bizarre but quiet man with few friends, was the oldest of five children but considered the black sheep of the family.The family moved to the Belgian Congo in 1956, shortly after Marc's birth, but returned in 1960. His parents, both teachers, divorced soon after.He was described as a problem child who had to change schools at least four times."Marc always had a problem with authority. He always had to be right and it was best not to contradict him," his mother said.He was repeatedly caught red-handed by police for minor crime like breaking into cars but still managed to obtain a qualification as an electrician.His mother said he fled home 23 years ago and severed all ties with the family.His youngest brother committed suicide a few years ago. His two other brothers are mailmen.Marc has a 12-year-old son Frederic from a first marriage and two children -- Andy, nearly three, and Celine, nine months -- with his second wife Michelle Martin.Martin has been charged with being an accomplice in the abduction and illegal imprisonment of children.She and Dutroux, who beat his first wife, had been living apart because she feared his rages.Until his arrest, Marc had been living with Frederic. The two other children stayed with Martin.He is officially unemployed but had been enjoying a health insurance benefit payment of 38,500 francs per month ($1,280)."He presented himself as a sick and disoriented man, blaming his stay in prison for his bad state of health," according to a dossier on Dutroux delivered to the media by Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck on Monday.The dossier said that Dutroux has always maintained his innocence but carefully complied with the conditions set for his early release.Judicial authorities have been criticised for insufficiently monitoring Marc Dutroux after his release from jail.

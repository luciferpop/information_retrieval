Shortfalls in U.S. stocks of middle distillates -- mainly heating oil and diesel -- have boosted the entire energy complex in recent weeks.IPE Brent crude continued to trade a narrow range, pulled lower by mild profit-taking after Monday's rally but meeting solid support from independent dealers on the exchange floor."The locals have been buying the dips today but basically the market has paused," said a broker.Oct Brent shed 19 cents to trade at $20.66 a barrel by 1646 GMT after posting a session low of $20.58 around midday. The expiry of Sept NYMEX crude at the close kept volumes thin.  "There's been very little paper going through this afternoon," said a broker."People are waiting for Sept to expire and then resume normal business tomorrow."Dealers said they saw floor interest in the Brent-NYMEX crude arbitrage, with locals buying October Brent and selling October NYMEX crude. The Oct spread narrowed by two cents to $1.44 a barrel.-- Mark Thompson, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7930

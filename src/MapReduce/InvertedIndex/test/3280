RUSSIA: Russian grain harvest seen at 77 mln tonnes.Russian grain harvest seen at 77 mln tonnes.Russia is likely to harvest 77 million tonnes of grain this year, and any imports will be matched by exports, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha said on Tuesday."The country can produce enough grain for its own needs. Exports and imports are almost equal," he told a news conference. "The prospect of a 77 million tonne grain harvest affords the possibility of balance in our own food supplies."  Zaveryukha did not give export or import figures, but Interfax news agency quoted him last week as predicting that grain exports could be four-five million tonnes this year and imports would be about the same.On Tuesday Zaveryukha said Russia was negotiating exports of grain to Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.Cross-country rail freight charges are very high in Russia, making imports to the Far East a cheap alternative to transporting Russian grain from the west of the country.Last year's drought-hit harvest was 63.4 million tonnes.--Peter Henderson, Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520

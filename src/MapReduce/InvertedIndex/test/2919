USA: IMM currency futures end mixed after FOMC inaction.IMM currency futures end mixed after FOMC inaction.IMM currency futures ended pit trading mixed after edging upward when the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, left short-term rates steady.Some traders tied the firming, which briefly tugged most currencies to the day's peaks, to "buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact" activities vis-a-vis the dollar."I'm surprised as well...but there must have been a small amount of insurance (dollar) buying before the meeting," said Chris Turner, currency strategist, IDEA Inc.He said those "just-in-case" long-dollar positions likely were unwound when the Fed took no action.  "When the FOMC was over, the dollar went offered," said a floor broker at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "But when the Redbook hit the street, the dollar rallied."Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in the first two weeks of August versus July, according to Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc Redbook retail sales index.Focus shifted to Wednesday's IFO business climate survey for softness that might bolster arguments for a German cut.But Turner said the currency market likely already had factored in any weakness in the German business survey during last week's dollar rally to 1.4950 from 1.4750 marks.  Turner also said his firm did not look for a German ease until the Bundesbank sees more months of evidence that M3 growth has slowed to within its four-percent to seven-percent target corridor.Other pundits, however, said slowing in July M3 growth to an 8.6-percent rate fueled expectations the Bundesbank will cut its 3.30-percent repo rate at Thursday's council meeting.Yen fell early after Japan ministry of finance senior official Eisuke Sakakibara was quoted as saying that even a dollar rise above 110.00 yen would have only a small chance of having an adverse effect on the Japanese economy.  Currencies dipped early in the session after a smaller-than-expected June U.S. trade deficit. The trade gap shrank 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion against forecasts for a $9.4-billion shortfall.At settlement, September yen fell $0.000050 to $0.009261, marks eased $0.0004 to $0.6728, Swiss francs firmed $0.0009 to $0.8313, Sterling gained $0.0032 to $1.5476, Canadian dollar slipped $0.0001 to $0.7288, Australian dollar lost $0.0041 to $0.7854, and the Mexican peso rose $0.000350 to $0.131875.

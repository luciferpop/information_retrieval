RUSSIA: Chechen rebel chief urges Lebed to prevent attack.Chechen rebel chief urges Lebed to prevent attack.Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed on Tuesday to Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed to prevent federal troops from using force to clear separatist fighters from the capital Grozny.Interfax news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying that Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy in Chechnya, should "use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness".  Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, vowed on Tuesday to use aircraft and heavy artillery to retake Grozny, much of which was seized by rebels on August 6.But Lebed, who is locked in a power struggle with the interior ministry over the handling of the 20-month-old conflict, has advocated talks with the separatists and opposed aerial bombardment, which he believes could spread the fighting.Maskhadov said the Chechen side reacted "very calmly" to Pulikovsky's warning to Grozny residents that they should abandon the city by Thursday or risk being caught up in an all-out Russian counter-offensive."Implementation of the threat by commander Pulikovsky will not bring glory to Russian weapons, but will only make the situation even worse, driving it into a dead end," Interfax quoted him as saying.

TAIWAN: Taiwan frets over capital flows to China.Taiwan frets over capital flows to China.Taiwan's president has urged the central bank to study how to control capital outflows to China in a further bid to limit the island's economic exposure on its main rival's turf, a local newspaper said on Tuesday.President Lee Teng-hui, in a meeting on Monday, also pressed central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong to find ways to better manage indirect investment by Taiwanese banks in China, the Economic Daily News reported.President Lee's office and a central bank spokesperson declined to comment on the reported meeting, which the newspaper described as a call by Lee for a review of the central bank's policy toward China.Speculation that Taipei might change its China policies has mounted since Lee cautioned on August 14 that the island needed to avoid over-dependence on the mainland for investment.Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Sunday the government would maintain a "consistent" policy on mainland investments and not impose additional restrictions.Some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured more than US$20 billion into China since the late 1980s, channeling capital indirectly through Hong Kong and other centres to comply with a nearly five-decade-old ban on direct links with communist China.Taiwan and China have been arch rivals since a civil war separated them in 1949.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to recover the island by force if it seeks independence.

Futures prices for the winter months have been decreasing over the past week."People trading the back months are probably looking at what is happening to the front months, which rallied for two to three weeks and now are coming off pretty hard," said one New York-based futures broker.September Palo Verde (PV) ended down 30 cents at $20.90, while October PV ended down 30 cents at $16.10.Remaining PV deferreds ended down 15-70 cents.NYMEX said an estimated total of 316 COB contracts traded, while an estimated 42 PV contracts traded.-- Chris Reese, New York Power Desk 212-859-1627

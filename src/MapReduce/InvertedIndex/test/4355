GERMANY: Lower U.S. corn, soybean crops possible-Oil World.Lower U.S. corn, soybean crops possible-Oil World.Dry conditions in U.S. growing regions could result in even lower 1996 corn and soybean crops than forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Aug 12, the independent newsletter Oil World said."If current forecasts of insufficient moisture in several parts of the Midwest materialise and/or damage occurs from early frosts, there is the risk that actual yields will even fall below the...USDA figures, not only for corn but also for soybeans," it said.USDA's forecast for corn was lower than expected at 8.695 billion bushels while soybean was neutral at 2.300 billion.Oil World said if dry weather over the next three weeks cut soybean yields to only 35.5 bushels per acre compared with 36.2 forecast by USDA, the crop may only be 2.250 billion.The soybean crop was inferior to last year's because of late plantings, delayed growth and dry conditions.Oil World forecast a high degree of soycomplex and grain price volatility in the next two to four weeks.Further ahead, corn price gains could encourage area shifts from oilseeds into grains in early 1997, enhancing tight U.S. supply and demand balances and world balances in their wake. -Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275

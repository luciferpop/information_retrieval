USA: Nader wins Green Party presidential nominination.Nader wins Green Party presidential nominination.Consumer rights crusader Ralph Nader was nominated on Monday as the Green Party's presidential candidate.The nomination highlighted a Green Party conference, titled "Building Critical Mass -- Green Gather '96," held at the University of California at Los Angeles.Nader is a potent consumer advocate who came to prominence 30 years ago for attacking automobile safety standards. He runs the Washington D.C.-based Centre for the Study of Responsive Law.Around 400 audience members cheered "Go Ralph Go" and waved "Nader '96" placards at a campus auditorium, where Nader gave his acceptance speech. It came after an afternoon meeting in which Green Party representatives from 30 states formally nominated him."He's currently on 12 (state) ballots and we expect to have him on 30," said Michael Feinstein, a Green Party spokesman. He expects another 15 states to make Nader a write-in candidate for the Nov. 5 election."All but four states have a write-in process," he said.Nader's previous bid for the presidency came in 1992, when he ran as an Independent in the New Hampshire primary."The pressure to exploit the consumers and workers continues," Nader said.He urged greater consumer control of utilities, health insurance and television programming. "We're the landlords of the public airwaves," he said, denouncing television as an "electronic molester."He repeatedly criticised large corporations for weakening democracy and degrading the national culture."In the last twenty we have had an extraordinary concentration of power and wealth in fewer and fewer global corporations," Nader said.In the political arena, he called for 12-year term limits and publicly funded elections.Responding to criticism that he was stealing the Democratic Party's votes, he said "We're sick of being told we have to chose between the bad and the worse."

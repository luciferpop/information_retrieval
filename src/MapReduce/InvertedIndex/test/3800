USA: U.S. cash soymeal - Offers steady amid slow market.U.S. cash soymeal - Offers steady amid slow market.U.S. rail and truck cash soymeal basis offers were little changed Tuesday as more processors switched their offers to the September CBOT contract from the August, cash soymeal brokers said.The switch to September had the effect of lowering offers at some locations where sellers didn't compensate for the nearly $6.00 spread between the two contracts.Sellers made the move because Wednesday is the last trading day for the August contract.Buying interest was low. "It's been slow," a Minnesota broker said. "Everything's hand to mouth."The export market remained flat, with one broker reporting four or five barges traded on Monday, but no major business on the horizon.Rail cars were in short supply in Illinois. A Tennessee broker attributed some of the tightness to the ongoing corn harvest in the Southeast, which has boosted demand for rail cars there.

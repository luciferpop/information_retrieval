AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian Senate elects defector as deputy.RTRS-Australian Senate elects defector as deputy.Australia's Senate, the upper house of parliament, on Tuesday elected Mal Colston as its deputy president amid controversy over his decision to quit the Labor Party earlier in the day.  "My loyalties will be directed not to any particular party or group of parties, rather my loyalty will be directed to the Senate ..." Colston said in parliament after his election.  Colston resigned as a Labor party senator to complete his present term, which ends in 1999, as an independent in the Senate.Labor opposition Senate leader John Faulkner said he was disappointed Colston had not made his loyalties to the Labor party clear."It is very disappointing that he did not mention the Labor party as Mal Colston has been a Labor party senator since the mid-1970's," Faulkner told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio.  "He was endorsed as a labor party senator ... and as far as I'm concerned he has a primary loyalty to the Australian Labor Party," Faulkner said.But Colston had indicated to a senior Labor member earlier on Tuesday that he would support the Labor party on the key policy issues in parliament, Faulkner said."It remains to be seen how he will vote, but I am sure all those people that cast a ballot for the Labor party in the Senate in Queensland and elected Mal Colston will demand that level of loyalty from Mal Colston," Faulkner said.  Queensland Labor party state secretary Mike Kaiser said in a statement on Tuesday that he understood Colston had resigned because the federal Labor party had chosen someone else for the position of Deputy President of the Senate.In a fax to Kaiser, Colston said he had resigned because of significant differences between himself and other members of the federal Labor party."There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Colston's decision to resign was designed to put a loaded gun to Labor's head, but the Party was not prepared to give in to blackmail," Kaiser said.  Colston's resignation from the Labor party means he is no longer bound by party policy and can decide his own position on legislation.The Labor opposition and minor parties hold the balance of power in the Senate and have pledged to block some of the new Liberal-National government's reforms, including the partial privatisation of Telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

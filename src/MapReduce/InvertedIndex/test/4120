USA: Former mayor sues to halt Tampa, Fla, stadium vote.Former mayor sues to halt Tampa, Fla, stadium vote.Former Tampa, Fla., mayor William Poe filed suit to block a September referendum on a tax financing plan for a new Tampa Bay Buccaneers stadium.The case was filed Monday in Hillsborough County Court against county Elections Supervisor Pam Iorio. Circuit Judge James Whittmore scheduled a hearing on Friday.Hillsborough voters go to the polls Sept 3 to decide whether to adopt a half-cent sales tax increase that would raise $2.7 billion over 30 years for schools, roads and public safety as well as a new $168 million stadium for the Bucs.The lawsuit seeks to have the measure thrown off the ballot on grounds that it would be unconstitutional to give tax dollars to a private company.It said the stadium the Bucs currently use is adequate and the only reason for building a new one "is to allow the owner of the private, for-profit business already using the stadium to make a higher profit."The suit also said the ballot language is unclear and that local governments did not followed their own regulations in rushing to put the proposal on the ballot.Poe was Tampa's mayor from 1974 to 1979. The stadium would be financed with revenue bonds issued by the Tampa Sports Authority, under an agreement with the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County.--Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013

RUSSIA: Civilians flee Grozny, say Russian assault begun.Civilians flee Grozny, say Russian assault begun.Thousands of civilians struggled out of the Chechen capital any way they could on Tuesday and many said Russian forces had already started carrying out a threat to bomb the city to drive out rebels."The whole city is on its way out. We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more," said Nina Madayeva, who added that 12 planes had bombed a district to the south west overnight. The acting commander of Russian forces in Chechnya has given civilians until Thursday to leave.  Civilians have been trying to flee Grozny for the past two weeks, since the rebels sparked a flare-up in fighting by attacking the city. But on Tuesday there appeared to be more than on any of the previous days.Most of them were on foot rather than in cars and buses.Konstantin Pulikovksy, acting commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, on Monday gave civilians 48 hours to leave before he unleashes an all-out bombardment. He said on Tuesday that the situation could only be resolved by force.Itar-Tass news agency quoted Pulikovsky as saying artillery had already opened up in Grozny with "pinpoint strikes" against the rebels, who control most of the city, but that aircraft were not being used.

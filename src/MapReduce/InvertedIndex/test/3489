AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Australia hits wealthy with retirement tax.RTRS - Australia hits wealthy with retirement tax.The Australian government announced on Tuesday a 15 percent tax surcharge on the retirement savings of wealthy people to raise about A$500 million annually as part of an overhaul of the superannuation (pension) system.The measure, outlined in the 1996/97 (July/June) budget announced on Tuesday, accounts for the bulk of net savings to be achieved under the overhaul, which also changes the tax treatment of employer contributions to retirement funds.  The budget papers list the effect from all the changes would be an increase in revenue of A$523 million in 1997/98 -- the first full year of the new arrangements -- rising to A$582 million in 1999/2000.The surcharge, to be phased in for annual incomes between A$70,000 and A$85,000 and to apply in full for people earning above that, will raise A$480 million in 1997/98, rising to A$530 in 1999/2000.The government estimates it will affect 355,000 tax-payers and will apply to the superannuation contributions made by, or on behalf of, high-income earners.  "The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation (retirement savings) fairer," Treasurer Peter Costello said in his budget speech.He also confirmed in his budget speech the government would honour the previous administration's pledge to make public contributions to workers' retirement savings.These contributions, originally meant to have been delivered by way of tax cuts by the former Labor government, were costed in the 1995/96 budget at A$1.1 billion in 1998/99.  Costello also said the government would raise the age limit for retirement contributions to 70 from 65 years and allow people on low incomes to take a wage rise in lieu of employers paying mandatory contributions into their retirement funds.The government will also allow a tax rebate for contributions made on behalf of a low-income spouse.The standard contribution limit, which enables employers to claim tax relief on their contributions to a worker's retirement savings, has been dropped, Costello said.This change in the tax treatment of employer contributions will raise about A$40 million annually, the budget papers show.  He also confirmed that financial institutions would be able to create retirement savings accounts as a simple, low-cost superannuation product.-- Canberra bureau 616-273-2730

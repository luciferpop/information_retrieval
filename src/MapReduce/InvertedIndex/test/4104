"These long-range charts have a way of flip-flopping."However, meteorologists advised more quick map changes are likely, which could restore the cold next week in the Midwest.  Currently, scattered showers are forecast for this week, but most amounts will be 0.50 inch or less. A few areas may receive an inch or more along the Mississippi Valley.Tropical Storm Dolly in the Gulf of Mexico should evolve into a hurricane and push rain into the southern Midwest late Friday, said Fred Gesser, Weather Express Inc meteorologist.For next week, Weather Services Burgio said the latest maps suggest normal to above normal temperatures for the Midwest.

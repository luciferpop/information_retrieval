USA: U.S. ag attache boosts Argentina wheat forecast.U.S. ag attache boosts Argentina wheat forecast.A U.S. agricultural attache pegged Argentina 1996/97 wheat production at 14.0 million tonnes, up from 13.0 million tonnes forecast last month.The new estimate is in line with U.S. Agriculture Department's forecast for Argentina wheat production released in the August World Agricultural Supply and Demand Report.The Buenos Aires-based attache said final wheat sown area will be close to 7.0 million hectares, which with normal losses of 3-5 percent, would result in a harvested area of around 6.5-6.6 million hectares.  The agricultural attache also revised up his 1995/96 Argentina wheat crop estimate to 9.0 million tonnes from 8.8 million tonnes.The attache said the revised forecast is based on a harvested area of 4.8 million hectares, quantities already sold and those in farmer-owned and country elevator storage.USDA pegged 1995/96 Argentina wheat production at 8.6 million tonnes in the August supply and demand report.The attache also said there is concern that following harvest in December and January, the market will be flooded with wheat which would put considerable pressure on local prices, as storage capacity is generally regarded as insufficient to handle such a large harvest."Many traders believe that by next January or February, new crop Argentine wheat will be the cheapest available worldwide and that China and Egypt, among others, will be ready buyers," the attache wrote in the report.

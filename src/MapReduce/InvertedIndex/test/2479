DUBAI: Iran pins hope on Petronas deal to ease isolation.Iran pins hope on Petronas deal to ease isolation.Tehran is banking on Malaysia's Petronas acquisition of a 30 percent stake in a project to develop two oil and gas fields in Iran to deflect intense U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic republic."This shows that unilateral moves cannot isolate the Iranian oil industry. It also indicates that the U.S. position is not shared by foreign oil companies," an Iranian oil official told Reuters by telephone from Tehran on Tuesday.The official predicted the deal "will have a positive impact" on other foreign companies seeking business in Iran's lucrative oil and gas industries. "The deal indicates that the U.S. cannot dictate its own will."But the key question now is whether other companies will follow suit in the face of tough new U.S. moves to penalise non-American firms that invest in energy projects in Iran and Libya, analysts and diplomats said."Iran is trying everything possible to break the sanctions and the isolation," said an oil industry executive in the Gulf."But the Americans aren't joking and other companies like ours are likely to remain cautious. Iran is a risky market."French oil group Total SA on Monday said Malaysia's state-owned energy company Petronas had taken a 30 percent stake in the Sirri A and E fields through its Carigali subsidiary in a deal approved by the Iranian authorities.The announcement, ending a search of more than a year for partners in the $600 million project, came two weeks after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill which would penalise foreign firms which invest $40 million or more annually in Iran's or Libya's energy sectors.The Iranian official said Petronas sealed the deal before the new U.S. sanctions were made law. But the official and Gulf oil analysts predicted the news would still anger Washington."This is outright defiance. It will be seen by Washington as open defiance of Clinton's bill," said one analyst. "At the same time, companies will be taking a risk if they invest in Iran."But a British diplomat underlined the rift between the United States and its European allies who were outraged at the U.S. sanctions."We will be perfectly content to trade with Iran. We don't have a problem with that. There are opportunites in Iran and European companies will follow their governments' leads," the Gulf-based diplomat said. "Other companies are likely to follow Petronas's lead."Total, which has always said its dealings with both Iran and Libya were within French and international law, said earlier this month that the U.S. sanctions would not apply to Sirri.The Sirri deal, Iran's largest with a foreign firm since its 1979 revolution, attracted fierce opposition from Washington which accuses Tehran of backing "international terrorism".Iran denies the charges.DuPont Co unit Conoco Inc had to dissolve an earlier deal with Iran for the development of the two Sirri fields after pressure from the White House.Iran said the new sanctions were doomed to fail because they lacked support from European states which have refused to adopt the U.S. hardline stand on Tehran.Total signed a contract on July 13, 1995 with the National Iranian Oil Company covering all phases of the development of the two fields, including studies, delineation, development and production start-up.

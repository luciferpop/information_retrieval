VATICAN: Pope in good health after abdominal problem.Pope in good health after abdominal problem.Pope John Paul, who suffered an abdominal problem last week, was in good health on Tuesday and took part in a seminar on Eastern Europe at his summer residence, the Vatican said.Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters he found the 76-year-old Pope in "good form and spirits" at the Castelgandolfo residence south of Rome.He said the Polish Pontiff was taking active part in a two-day seminar on Slavic cultures attended by 17 academics and scientists from countries in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.The spokesman said the Pope would return to the Vatican for several hours as planned on Wednesday for his weekly general audience.The Pope entered hospital briefly for a checkup last week after complaining of pains and took antibiotics for the unspecified abdominal problem caused by a mild infection.The infection also caused the Pope to suffer a mild fever.A CAT (Computed Axial Tomography) scan showed nothing out of order, particularly in relation to a 1992 operation to remove an intestinal tumour that was starting to turn malignant.The Pontiff looked rosy-cheeked but tired on Sunday when he last appeared in public at Castelgandolfo.The Vatican has said visits to Hungary and France in September would go ahead as planned.

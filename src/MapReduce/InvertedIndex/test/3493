AUSTRALIA: Australian families, elderly win in budget.Australian families, elderly win in budget.Australia's new conservative government has dramatically boosted spending for families and the elderly in its 1996/97 budget, released on Tuesday.Treasurer Peter Costello delivered a promised tax rebate to low and middle income families.The family tax initiative, to apply from January, would cost the government A$395.0 million in fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), rising to A$1.081 billion a year by 1999/00, budget papers show.It was part of a 9.2 percent increase in government assistance to families with children to A$13.685 billion in 1996/97 from A$12.510 billion in the previous financial year.  The family tax initiative increased the tax-free threshhold -- below which no tax is paid -- by A$1,000 for the first child for double-income families earning less than A$70,000 a year.The eligible income rises A$3,000 for each extra child.The benefit lifts the tax-free threshhold A$2,500 a year for single-income families with a taxable income less than A$65,000 a year.The benefit would be paid in cash to low income families.Spending on the elderly was budgeted to increase 6.8 percent to A$14.243 billion from A$13.333 billion in 1995/96.  The increase follows the government's pledge in the March 2 election campaign to increase spending on hostels, home and community care packages and widen eligibility for payments to partners of pensioners, and index pension payments twice yearly to peg them at 25 percent of average weekly male earnings.Costello's budget also increased the age limit for contributions to pension savings schemes, known as superannuation, and allowed capital gains tax exemptions for small businesses sold to fund retirement.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

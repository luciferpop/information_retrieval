CHINA: Chinese capital has that sinking feeling.Chinese capital has that sinking feeling.China's capital, Beijing, is sinking by 10 mm to 20 mm (0.39 in to 0.79 in) a year because of excessive groundwater use, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.Over the past 40 years, the ground has sunk by more than 700 mm (27.6 in) in the city's eastern suburbs and by 600 mm (23.6 in) in the northeastern suburbs, damaging buildings and underground pipelines, Xinhua said. The rate at which it is sinking has increased since 1987, the agency said."The subsidence is mainly caused by excessive groundwater use," Xinhua quoted Hong Libo, chief engineer of the Beijing Institute of Surveying and Map Design Research, as saying.Hong attributed the increased groundwater use to rising industrial extraction and water consumption caused by the city's growing population, the agency said.The city's southern and northwestern suburbs were also sinking, but not as fast as the eastern and northeastern areas, it said.Experts warned that continued sinking might threaten the city's future. The only way to halt it was to restructure industries, limit groundwater consumption and control the expansion of the city, Xinhua said.

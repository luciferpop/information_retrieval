BURUNDI: Burundi's Buyoya sacks top chiefs in shake-up.Burundi's Buyoya sacks top chiefs in shake-up.Burundi's new Tutsi military strongman on Tuesday sacked the ethnically-divided country's three most powerful military officers, his spokesman announced.Jean-Luc Ndizeye told Reuters that Pierre Buyoya, who seized power in a bloodless coup on July 25, had dismissed powerful chief-of-staff Colonel Jean Bikomagu, head of the gendarmerie Colonel Pascal Simbanduko and Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, head of the military at the presidential palace.  Ndizeye said Buyoya had appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Vincent Niyungeko as new chief-of-staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Muhorako as chief-of-staff of the gendarmerie and Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Ngurunziza as head of military at the presidential palace. All are Tutsi officers."With the new changes the president has the right to choose who he works with. It's not a question of competence or incompetence. It's just to show that President Buyoya has a free hand," Ndizeye added.Analysts said the dismissals of the hardline and powerful officers may be a move by Buyoya to placate regional anger over the coup that ousted civilian Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. Neighbours have imposed an embargo on Burundi.Bikomagu and other unnamed senior military commanders were implicated in a U.N. report on an attempted coup in Burundi in October 1993 in which Burundi's first freely-elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was murdered by Tutsi soldiers.

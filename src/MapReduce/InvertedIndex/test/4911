PORTUGAL: Yields could gain at Portugal 5-yr bond sale.Yields could gain at Portugal 5-yr bond sale.Yields could be slightly higher than secondary market levels at the Treasury's sale on Tuesday of up to 20 billion escudos of five-year bonds, analysts and traders said.As a result, the Treasury may opt not to place all the paper, they added."The yields bid will be certainly higher than eight percent and could reach 8.07 percent," said one trader.He said the majority of the bids would probably be around 8.04 percent.At the last sale of March 2001 bonds on July 25, the average yield was 8.0161 percent. The bonds closed at 8.0 percent on the secondary market on Monday.Results of Tuesday's auction are due at around 1000 GMT.Traders said the banks would be adopting a cautious line because of uncertainty over what the Federal Reserve might decide at its Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.Any rate rise would be potentially damaging for peripheral bond markets such as Portugal, traders said.They said that final investors were still out of the market and banks were seeking a premium to buy at the sale.-- Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035

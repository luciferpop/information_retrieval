AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian budget saves A$3.9 bln in 1996/97.RTRS-Australian budget saves A$3.9 bln in 1996/97.Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's Tuesday budget implements measures that boost the bottom line by A$3.9 billion in 1996/97, rising to A$7.2 billion in the following fiscal year.The budget contains no major fiscal surprises. Every big measure has been announced prior to the budget or widely leaked.With an estimated no-policy-change starting point of A$9.6 billion, this year's measures are projected to produce a A$5.6 billion underlying budget deficit -- that is, without asset sales.  That deficit will fall to just A$1.5 billion in the following year and turn into the promised underlying surplus in 1998/99, even without the full A$8 billion in cuts that the government has foreshadowed since March, the budget papers show.Asset sales will keep the headline balance in surplus throughout the four-year period covered by the forward estimates. This year's headline surplus is A$474 million.The measures appear overwhelmingly on the revenue side: many major items accompanied by a thousand and one little cuts. Gross spending cuts save A$4.4 billion in 1996/97, more than the gross value of all measures.  But there is also extra spending, mostly to fulfill promises made in the campaign for the March 2 election. In net terms, spending falls by only A$2.9 billion in 1996/97, still contributing the bulk of the savings.The spending cuts really kick in during 1997/98, when A$5.2 billion is saved despite the extra spending.(Accompanying reports itemise spending and revenue measures.)The biggest single spending cut is on labour market programmes, essentially cancelling the Working Nation funding that the former government announced two years ago.  But the measure has little long term effect. It will save A$575 million this year and A$1.0 billion next year, but the Working Nation funding did not go beyond then and the savings evaporate.The revenue side -- which is vulnerable to parliamentary obstruction -- is more modest: a net gain of A$1.0 billion in 1996/97 rising to A$2.0 billion in the following year.Again, more substantial revenue gains are offset by sacrifices to meet election commitments.In one respect, the figures are better than they appear.  The big A$800-million-a-year crackdown on wealthy tax avoiders -- announced by the former government in February -- has collapsed to an estimated revenue gain of just A$100 million in 1997/98.The tax office does not know how much can be gained after that and so the forward estimates do not allow for it.Also, the forward estimates still allow for the government's superannuation co-payment, a public contribution to workers' retirement savings that the former Labor government announced last year.  This item is still budgeted as costing A$1.1 billion in 1998/99, the year that the budget moves into surplus. The following year the superannuation contribution costs A$2.4 billion, with the budget in a bigger surplus.Revenue from asset sales, a major difference between the headline and underlying deficits, is estimated at A$5.1 billion in 1996/97, mostly proceeds from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and some of the government's airport portfolio.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

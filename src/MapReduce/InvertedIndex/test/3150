SOUTH AFRICA: South African investment growth on track - Erwin.South African investment growth on track - Erwin.South Africa was on course to attracting the kind of investment needed to reach the target of six percent growth, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said."The fundamentals in the economy with regard to investment potential, trade potential are...looking sound and we are quite happy with the levels of investment that are occurring," he told a media briefing at parliament.Key projects included the recently launched Maputo corridor, linking the industrial heartland around Johannesburg with the Mozambican port.The same corridor concept was being extended to the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the area around Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape, and in the Free State."The number of investment projects that are emerging...is truly quite exciting and over the next few months these will be unfolding on a regular basis," Erwin said."I think that what we can foresee is that the level of investment that is needed to get us to the six percent growth rate is definitely within our grasp."We are not talking about nothing here. We are talking about some very exciting investment initiatives."One drawback remained the fact that many existing industries were uncompetitive by world standards, but this was being addressed by a series of cluster studies on key sectors.These were aimed at identifying strengths and weaknesses and ways in which productivity and competitiveness could be improved.Erwin added that negotiations with the European Union on a proposed free trade agreement were due to resume in September but it was clear that the current offer by the EU posed many difficulties for South Africa."The proposal by the EU is inherently a complicated proposal...so we have to consider our response very carefully," he said."As it stands right at the moment...it would look as if we are in for a fairly protracted negotiation."-- Parliamentary office +27 21 403-2502

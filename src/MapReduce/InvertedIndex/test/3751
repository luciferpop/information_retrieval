USA: Montgomery County, Texas, bond proposal offered.Montgomery County, Texas, bond proposal offered.A judge proposed that Montgomery County, Texas, issue $26 million of general obligation bonds to finance construction of court facilities and other projects, the Houston Chronicle reported Tuesday.County Judge Alan Sadler told the newspaper the bond issue could attract $15.5 million in matching funds.The issue would finance construction of a civic center, remodeling of the county courthouse, construction of a court annex in southern Montgomery county and road and park improvements.Sadler said the debt probably would not require a tax rate increase if the tax base continues to grow by at least three percent annually as expected.He told the newspaper the plan still needs fine-tuning, but that he hoped to win local government approval to put it before voters as early as January.--U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650

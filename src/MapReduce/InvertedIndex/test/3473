AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Costello hopes Senate split boosts budget.RTRS-Costello hopes Senate split boosts budget.Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday that he hoped the desertion of an opposition senator improved the chances of the budget passing through the upper house of parliament."I hope it improves it," Costello said when asked what implications the split had for the budget's chances in the Senate.Earlier, Senator Mal Colston quit the opposition Labor Party, issuing a statement that recognised the government's mandate to implement some new policies.  With Liberal-National government support, he was later voted deputy president of the Senate.The Liberal-Nationals are two votes short of a majority in the Senate.If Colston backs the government, which announced a deficit-slashing budget on Tuesday, then it might gain passage of contentious bills with just the support of the other Independent or, less probably, one of the two Greens senators.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

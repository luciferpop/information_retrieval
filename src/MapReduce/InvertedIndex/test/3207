RUSSIA: Russians,rebels deal peacefully in war-zone oasis.Russians,rebels deal peacefully in war-zone oasis.As Russian troops and Chechen rebels square off in the tense, battle-shattered city of Grozny, both sides are peacefully cooperating in a neighbouring town.All they want, they say, is for politicians to leave them alone in this war-zone "oasis".Argun, 15 km (10 miles) east of Grozny, appeared quiet on Tuesday compared with the regional capital, most of which was seized by separatist fighters on August 6 and turned into a battleground."We, the fighters, are keeping in constant contact with Russian military staff here and escort the OMON (crack police force) when they go to pick up food," local rebel commander Abu Khamzatov said.As he spoke, a Russian armoured vehicle passed by, packed with a dozen confused Russian policemen and Chechen guerrillas shouting their battle cry -- "Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest).Russian OMON servicemen at a post nearby seemed unimpressed by the drivepast."The Chechens explained the need to convoy us by a desire to rule out any provocations," said an OMON officer who refused to give his name. "That sounded reasonable enough."When separatist fighters seized parts of Grozny and rolled into other Chechen towns, Russian forces positioned there had to make up their minds."We soon realised that hopes for reinforcements and arms from Khankala (a key Russian base near Grozny) would never come. We had to make a deal with the rebels," the OMON officer said.He said all sorts of options had been discussed."The rebels suggested that we disarm and promised money and an escort to see us off," he said. "But Khankala would not take us and we have nowhere to go.""Our only desire is to get home safely with our arms after our duty tour ends on August 23," he added.The officer said that the deal embraced all Russian troops in Argun-- except one commando battalion just 500 metres (yards) away from the OMON post."Their commander had been killed and now they are fighting every night," he said.But Argun has become a stop-over point for tens of thousands refugees hurrying to flee Grozny after Russia's acting military commander in Chechnya General Konstantin Pulikovsky threatened to shell the city."There are too many refugees in Argun," said the OMON officer. "We and the rebels have a common aim of preventing senseless bloodshed and destruction here".The OMON troops stationed in Argun had been sent in from the ethnic republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia, also situated in the volatile North Caucasus.The force is made up of both ethnic Russians and representatives of the republic's Moslem ethnic groups.However beneficial the deal with rebels, the sight of separatists convoying troops can hardly add to morale among the OMON servicemen."When I see this convoy I have a split feeling," a policemen from the town of Cherkessk said. "On the one hand I am ashamed of our impotence, but on the other hand I admire these Chechen guys who are fighting for their freedom."An ultimatum announced by the Russian military commander in Chechnya General Konstantin Pulikovsky to rebels in Grozny to withdraw or or face bombardment has caused fresh problems to the Russian commanders in Argun."The rebels have so far guaranteed our safety," the OMON officer said. "But they also said if bloodshed starts in Grozny the same will happen in Argun."Rebel commanders were cool. "We have an accord and it will hold if the politicians do not make us fight," a local rebel commander Turpal said.

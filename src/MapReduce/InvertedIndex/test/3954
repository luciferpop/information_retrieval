UK: Halifax questions need for new UK rate cuts.Halifax questions need for new UK rate cuts.Britain's largest mortgage lender Halifax Building Society said on Tuesday it believed any further cuts in official interest rates would be unlikely to provide any more help to Britain's slowly-reviving housing market."(A rate cut) would be more politically inspired than by the needs of the housing market," society chairman Jon Foulds said at Halifax's interim results briefing.A general election must be held by May 1997.Britain's official base rate is currently 5.75 percent and has been cut four times since December 1995."We believe that rates are the bottom of the trough," said Mike Blackburn, chief executive of the society, adding that even if rates were cut again financial markets expect them to start moving higher at the end of 1996.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5113

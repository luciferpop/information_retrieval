AUSTRALIA: GOLF-ALLENBY SELECTED AS CAPTAIN'S CHOICE.GOLF-ALLENBY SELECTED AS CAPTAIN'S CHOICE.President's Cup international team captain Peter Thomson on Tuesday named Australian Robert Allenby as one of his two nominated players to face the United States next month.Thomson said fellow Australians Peter Senior and Wayne Riley were chasing the final spot in his 12-man team for the Ryder Cup-style team event in Washington from September 13-15.But both Senior and Riley could make the team if Japan's Jumbo Ozaki decides not to take up his automatic invitation, Thomson said.The international team will feature the top 10 available non-Europeans in the world rankings plus two players selected by Thomson.Five-times British Open champion Thomson has yet to confirm his team after replacing fellow Australian David Graham as non-playing captain last month.Thomson said Allenby would play as an automatic selection if Ozaki, ranked six in the world, did not play, freeing places for both Riley and Senior."I expect to hear from Jumbo this week," Thomson said.World number one Greg Norman, fellow Australian Steve Elkington, Zimbabwe's Nick Price and Ernie Els of South Africa are expected to lead the international team's challenge.The Americans won the inaugural President's Cup in 1994.

ARGENTINA: Argentina to set up $3 billion contingency fund.Argentina to set up $3 billion contingency fund.Argentina's Central Bank said on Tuesday that it plans to set up a contingency fund against possible banking liquidity crises of about $3.0 billion.A Central Bank official told reporters the bank has already received $6.3 billion in offers, including $1.5 billion from the U.S. Chase Manhattan Bank and $1.0 billion from France's Societe Generale.  Eleven other banks have also made offers."The banks have pledged that in the case of a liquidity crisis within the next two to five years...they automatically will disburse a credit line against government bonds upon request by the Central Bank," the official said.The Central Bank said on Friday that it would set up a contingency fund to cushion banks against any possible capital flight similar to the one triggered by the December 1994 Mexican peso devaluation. But it said at the time that the fund would be of only about $2.0 billion.  Central Bank chief Pedro Pou said the bank would now study the offers before making a final decision, hinting the full amount could be even larger. He declined to provide an estimated day for the system to go into effect."The implementation of this program does not mean we're expecting any imminent crisis," he said. "This is just a reassurance in case a crisis erupts."Argentina lost some $8.0 billion in banks deposits after Mexico's "Tequila effect" jolted all major emerging markets.-- Patrick Adam, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 411-4612

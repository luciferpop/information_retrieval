BELGIUM: Extra police join Belgian international child hunt.Extra police join Belgian international child hunt.Police drafted in more investigators on Wednesday as an international hunt widened for two teenage girls abducted a year ago by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux in Belgium's deadly child-sex scandal.Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said up to 30 extra investigators would join a team seeking An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, seized by captors in Ostend last August.Dutroux has admitted kidnapping Marchal and Lambrecks. Their subsequent fate is a mystery."There are elements that allow us to believe that the two girls are still alive," Bourlet told a news conference late on Tuesday.The investigations went international on Tuesday as Belgium grappled with shock revelations of deaths, abductions and imprisonment of children by paedophile kidnappers. Police opened communications with a number of countries in their efforts to find the two missing girls.The media spotlight has been on the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and France. Dutch police reopened a number of dormant dossiers on missing children on Tuesday."We are at the moment establishing contact with police in other countries via the services of Interpol," Major Jean-Marie Boudin, spokesman for the Belgian Gendarmerie's special missing children squad, told Reuters.At least 15 children have disappeared in Belgium in the past six years. Seven have now been found dead, six are still missing and only two have so far been rescued.The nation was stunned at the weekend as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo. He admitted paying two accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) when they were abducted in June 1995.The two were starved to death early this year.Dutroux was formally charged on Friday with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children after police raided a house he owned in Charleroi and rescued 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez and 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne from a makeshift concrete dungeon.Both girls had been sexually abused.Michel Lelievre was charged with the same offence. Michelle Martin, Dutroux' second wife, has been charged as an accomplice, and Jean-Michel Nihoul with criminal association.Dutroux denied responsibility for the deaths on the grounds that at the time he was serving four months in jail for theft.But he did admit killing accomplice Bernard Weinstein for letting the girls die.The two girls will be buried in a private ceremony on Thursday followed by a televised public memorial service in Liege at which police expect up to 100,000 people.As the two friends lay side by side in white coffins on Tuesday, each bearing a brass plaque inscribed simply "Julie" and "Melissa", weeping people filed past at the rate of 500 an hour from early till late as Belgium poured out its grief.Against stern warnings from the prosecutor involved and his own mother, Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 from a 13-year sentence for multiple rape and child abuse.Police searching a house in a Charleroi suburb occupied by Lelievre found narrow, trench-like cells dug in the cellar floor with evidence of occupation by children.Child rights lawyer Michele Hirsch told Reuters the Belgian case was symptomatic of a global sickness."Whether you talk about paedophilia, prostitution, pornography or the traffic in human organs, people are increasingly being treated as a primary resource," she said. "It is a a global problem."

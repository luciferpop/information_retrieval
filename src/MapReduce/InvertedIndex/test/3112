SOUTH AFRICA: S.African PAC admits white civilians were targets.S.African PAC admits white civilians were targets.South Africa's radical black Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) acknowledged on Tuesday that its guerrillas had targeted white civilians but said it made no apologies.PAC leader Clarence Makwetu told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, that the PAC regretted the August 1993 killing of American student Amy Biehl in Gugulethu black township outside Cape Town by youths allied to the organisation.Biehl was stabbed and stoned to death by a mob that attacked her car when she was dropping off friends in the township at the time of a teachers' strike."This act occurred in the context of a strike for recognition by the South African Democratic Teachers' Union," Makwetu said."To support the strike, an operation was launched to stop deliveries from towns into the townships. Although the PAC was not involved, the Pan Africanist Student Organisation (PASO) acted in solidarity with their teachers. They wrongly targeted and killed Amy Biehl," he said."We expressed our regret and condolences to Amy Biehl's family in a letter to the U.S. ambassador (at the time)."We restate this position yet again through the truth commission. But misguided as the deed was, we support the amnesty applications of all those convicted and sentenced for the offence."Four PAC supporters have been jailed for 18 years each for killing Biehl, 26, from Newport Beach, California.Discussing the activities of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), Makwetu said "a new pattern arose in the 1990s where civilians within the white community were attacked"."The actual targets were decided by local commanders... Internally based operatives often made errors that APLA had earlier avoided."Makwetu described the killing of civilians as "departures which we as political leaders who declared war must and do take responsibility for".But he added: "We make no apologies. We have nothing to hide."The Truth and Reconciliation Commission this week is hearing submissions from political parties aimed at giving a broad perspective of their activities durig the apartheid years.The PAC broke away from the African National Congress in 1959 but never achieved the mass appeal of President Nelson Mandela's party.Less than two percent of South Africans voted for the PAC in the country's first all-race elections in April 1994.Police blamed APLA for a series of gun and grenade attacks in the years leading up to the election, including one on a Cape Town church service and others on white social gatherings.Makwetu said the PAC objected to the format of the truth commission because "our people who were forced to fight a war of liberation are being made to appear on the same platform as their aggressors"."Perpetrators of the apartheid crime against humanity as well as their victims are being equated," he said.The right-wing Freedom Front made its presentation to the commission on Monday and the National Party, led by former white president F.W. de Klerk, is due to present its submission on Wednesday.

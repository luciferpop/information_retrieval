MALAYSIA: Malaysia's 14-month low on tin surprises market.Malaysia's 14-month low on tin surprises market.The fall in Malaysia's tin price to a 14-month low on Tuesday was largely inexplicable though higher world tin stocks and a shift of funds to the equity market were possible factors, dealers said.The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed at 14.97 ringgit ($6.01) a kilo on Tuesday, three cents lower than the previous close and a support level of 15 ringgit.Three month tin on the London Metal Exchange closed steadily unchanged on Monday.  "But most European and American tin smelters are closed now for the summer holidays and the lower consumption is not unusual," he added.The KLTM's last lowest closing price was on June 1, 1995 at 14.60 ringgit.There were offers for 156 tonnes compared to bids for 121 tonnes on Tuesday.KLTM turnover fell to 128 tonnes from 145 tonnes. Buyers were Europeans, Japanese and locals. Traders said the Kuala Lumpur premium over the LME narrowed to $30 a tonne against $40 previously.  "The tin price is usually pinned to movements of copper and other base metals, LME stock figures and whether speculative funds are being moved to the equity market," he said. "In this case, I can't see a major reason."LME three month copper traded in a steady range of between $1,900 and 1,970 a tonne on Monday, before closing $15 higher.Tin moved in a tight range between $6,150 and $6,160 on the London market on Tuesday, while LME stocks of the metal rose 155 tonnes to 10,795 tonnes."The stock situation does indicate fundamental softness of tin," said a metals analyst in London.

GERMANY: Oil World sees lower Malaysia Sept palm oil stocks.Oil World sees lower Malaysia Sept palm oil stocks.Rising domestic and foreign palm oil demand will mostly offset higher Malaysian output which seasonally peaks in August/September and will reduce stocks in the country, the independent newsletter Oil World said.It said end-Septmeber stocks should be considerably below Oil World's June 14 forecast of 900,000 tonnes, but did not give a precise forecast.Malaysia's Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) last week put end-July stocks at 754,634 tonnes versus trade views of 790,000-800,000 tonnes amid high demand and reduced output.The recovery in import demand over the last two months was attributed to attractive palm oil prices versus soya, rape and other oils and fats, along with renewed Chinese buying.Soft oilseeds were in short supply and global crushings had slowed down in the third quarter, making the world market more dependent on palm oil.-Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275

RUSSIA: Rouble firms on T-bill, central bank dollar sales.Rouble firms on T-bill, central bank dollar sales.The rouble firmed on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Treasury bill auctions and dealers said a squeeze for roubles was also due to large dollar sales by the central bank last Friday."The dollar dipped ahead of T-bill auctions and high overnight rates are a confirmation of that," Konversbank dealer Igor Mamkov said. Rouble rates were unlikely to firm further today in otherwise calm trading, he said.On Wednesday the central bank is auctioning 7.5 trillion roubles of six-month paper and four trillion roubles of three-month bills.Overnight rouble credits yielded 50-70 percent compared with Monday's late 20-25 percent.Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5,297-5,300 per dollar, the same as in early trading, after 5,302-04 late on Monday. Tomorrow roubles edged up to 5,300-03 per dollar from yesterday's late 5,304-06.The central bank said it had set 5,290/5,320 as its bid and offer rates against the dollar on Tuesday."Banks want to catch the last wagon of the last train, as they expect a fall in T-bill yields. Even banks who usually offer funds are bidding today," Inkombank chief dealer Vladimir Kudryavtsev said.He added the rouble shortage also reflected heavy dolalr buying by commercial banks from the central bank on Friday."Banks bought dollars from the central bank for tomorrow settlement and the roubles left the market yesterday, so the rouble deficit can be felt now, but it is not total," he said.Some dealers said the central bank had sold up to $200 million on Friday.No comment from the central bank was immediately available.--Artyom Danielyan, Moscow newsroom (095) 941 8520

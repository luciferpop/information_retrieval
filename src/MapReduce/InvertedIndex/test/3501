Some airports are also supposed to be privatised in that year.Asset sales in 1996/97 were expected to total A$5.10 billion, with A$3.39 billion of that coming from the sale last July of the government's remaining 50.4 percent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. A further A$1.77 billion of proceeds from the sale were due by November 1997.Treasury said it anticipated that bids for the lease of Federal Airports in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and possibly Adelaide, would be sought in 1996/97, with the first sales finalised by the end of that year.  The remaining airports, with the possible exception of Sydney and Sydney-West, would be leased by the end of 1997/98.The leasing of Sydney and Sydney-West was to be deferred pending resolution of noise issues at Sydney and an enviromental impact study being conducted on a second Sydney airport.A scoping study on the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd was currently being carried out and proceeds from any sale were expected in 1996/97, Treasury said.The government had also decided to sell a number of common service businesses in the Department of Administrative Services.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273 2730

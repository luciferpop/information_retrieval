INDONESIA: Indonesia's armed forces plan Natuna exercise.Indonesia's armed forces plan Natuna exercise.Indonesia's armed forces plan to launch a big military exercise on and around the oil-rich Natuna islands next month, the official Antara news agency said on Tuesday."All types of operations and new weapons owned by the armed forces will be tested in the exercise on the Natuna islands," Lieutenant-General Wiranto, exercise director and chief of the army's strategic command (Kostrad), was quoted as saying.The exercise would run from September 8-19, Wiranto said, adding: "It is aimed at increasing the armed forces capabilities as a defence force."Wiranto said that the armed forces had previously launched joint military exercises on the same scale in 1988 and 1992."This exercise will become the biggest and most complicated," he said, adding that missiles, tanks, submarines and fighter aircraft would be used.At least 19,525 personnel, including elite special forces (Kopassus), marines, and air force paratroops would take part in the exercise, Wiranto added.Antara said the Natuna islands in South China Sea were chosen because of their sparse population and inaccessibility.In 1994, Indonesia signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Exxon Corp of the United States to exploit the Natuna gas fields, which contain an estimated 210 trillion cubic feet of gas.Indonesia recently questioned a Chinese maritime map that showed the Natunas as part of China's territory but accepted an explanation from Beijing which said they belonged to Jakarta.

USA: Plains feedlot cattle trade up $2 at $68 - trade.Plains feedlot cattle trade up $2 at $68 - trade.Plains feedlot cattle markets Tuesday were active, with brisk sales at $68.00, up $2.00 per cwt from a week ago, according to feedlot sources.About 45,000 head traded in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma areas and about 35,000 in Kansas. Final figures for the day were expected higher as paperwork gets processed.The day started slowly, with light sales of lesser grade cattle at $67.00, but quickly accelerated as packers started buying aggressively at $68.00, the sources said."They (packers) bought every head we offered at $68.00," one source at a fairly large feedlot in the Panhandle said.  Gains were powered by smaller showlists this week of market-ready cattle just as packers were running short on live supplies purchased two weeks ago, feedlot sources said.Higher boxed beef prices at midday also were tied to the active packer buying, with boxes quoted up $1.00 to $1.42, with choice heavyweight cuts up $1.42 at $104.10, according to USDA. There were 178 fabricated loads sold.Last week's declines in boxed beef prices reportedly encouraged renewed retail interest, resulting in a possible shift from pork for advertising features after the Labor Day holiday, market sources said.--Bob Janis 312-983-7347--

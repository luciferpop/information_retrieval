USA: U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting.U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting.U.S. debt futures finished mixed, with the short end settling near the day's highs, while the long end wrapped up a light, lackluster session on the defensive, traders and analysts said.However, both U.S. T-bond and Eurodollar futures are seen inching up slightly in the near term after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its much-awaited meeting without raising rates.U.S. Septmeber bonds set a session low of 110-23/32 in a knee-jerk reaction to the FOMC's announcement that there was no change in the U.S. monetary policy.  Several traders said one firm sold 7,000 September bond contracts after the FOMC announcement, which helped pressure the contract through the day's previous low of 110-27/32."They just loaded up the pit with supply," one floor source said.The contract traded inside Monday's range of 111-13/32 to 110-24/32 for most of the day, and most contracts closed only 01/32 lower."That doesn't exactly lead me to expect much in the way of price action on Wednesday," one trader said.  "Between now and then, there is not much to change things," said John Nyhoff, vice president and economist of Mitsubishi Financial Futures.Nyhoff expects Eurodollars to rise slightly, with December climbing to the 94.50 area.On Wednesday, July import and export prices will be released at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT and the July federal budget will be released at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT.  At the end of pit trade, September T-bonds were down 01/32 to 110-28/32, 10-year notes were flat at 108-19/32, munibonds rose 05/32 to 115-09/32, December Eurodollars were up one basis point at 94.21 and March Eurodollars were also up a basis point at 94.11, while March T-bills were one point higher at 94.69.

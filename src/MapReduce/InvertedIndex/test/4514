AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Australian Labor defector to support party.RTRS - Australian Labor defector to support party.Australian Labor Opposition Senate leader John Faulkner said on Tuesday that Mal Colston, a Labor senator who resigned from the party earlier in the day, had indicated he would support the party in the Senate."Senator Colston has indicated to Gareth Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, that he will support the party on all major issues before the Senate," Faulkner told reporters.  Faulkner said Colston had been pre-selected and endorsed by Labor for decades and the Labor party expected him to show a minimal amount of loyalty on the floor of the Senate."We will demand of Senator Colston that he show that minimal level of loyalty to the party that has supported him in public life for so long," Faulkner said.Colston said he intended to complete his present term in the Senate as an independent.  "My voting pattern in that chamber will be influenced by my long held Labor beliefs, by an acceptance that the present government has an electoral mandate to pursue a number of issues and by what I judge to be the most appropriate course of action for the people of Queensland (state)," he said in statement.Colston was unavailable for further comment.His resignation means he is no longer bound by party policy and can decide his own position on legislation.  The Labor opposition and minor parties hold the balance of power in the Senate and have pledged to block some of the new Liberal-National government's reforms, including the partial privatisation of Telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730

"There will be adjustments here and there in the light of redefined support or redefined missions but there will be no massive reduction in numbers," he added.France has about 1,300 troops stationed in Senegal, a former French colony.It has about 500 soldiers in Ivory Coast and contingents in Chad, Djibouti, Gabon and the Central African Republic, where it intervened in May under a defence pact to prevent an army revolt toppling elected president Ange-Felix Patasse.

RUSSIA: Yeltsin marks 1991 coup, says repeat unlikely.Yeltsin marks 1991 coup, says repeat unlikely.President Boris Yeltsin said a new coup d'etat was still possible in Russia but insisted it had no more chance of success than the botched hardline putsch five years ago that helped propel him to power.In an interview to be published on Wednesday in Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, quoted by Itar-Tass news agency on Tuesday, Yeltsin also bemoaned the combativeness of Russian society and its imperfect freedom."I don't rule out that under a certain coincidence of circumstances such (coup) attempts are possible, albeit very unlikely," Yeltsin said. "In any case, the results of such actions would be the same, if not sorrier, than in August 1991."In the last five years, society and Russian statehood itself have changed," he said. "The recent presidential elections clearly demonstrated that."The interview marked the fifth anniversary of the hardline communist coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which was launched on August 19, 1991 and ended three days later.Yeltsin, then newly elected president of Russia, rallied resistance in Moscow. The defeat of the plot helped him undermine Gorbachev and led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.The anniversary has been little celebrated and was marred by a bloody flare-up in the 20-month war in Chechnya.The president, whose aides on Tuesday had again to deny reports that he was ill, said the biggest danger for Russia was its failure to cast off the sharp divisiveness ingrained by decades of communist rule."In Russia, there is still a notable tendency to search for enemies and irreconcilable conflicts. So-called class hatred and the division between "us' and "them' are raising their heads," he said. "All this is a consequence of long years of living in a totalitarian state. And it will not vanish overnight.""We have still not graduated from that school where we will become familiar with the hard science of freedom," he added."But I am convinced Russia will definitely master it and become a truly free Russia. And that will be the main result of the August victory."

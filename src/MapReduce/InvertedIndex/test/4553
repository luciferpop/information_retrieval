AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Research seen key to Australia sugar growth.RTRS-Research seen key to Australia sugar growth.Research and development will become increasingly important to the sugar industry because more than 70 percent of growers had no spare land to bring into production, Harry Bonanno, chairman of the grower organisation CANEGROWERS, told the Sugar 2000 symposium on Tuesday.Growers would rely increasingly on vertical expansion, getting greater productivity from existing land, he said.An efficient and productive research and development function was needed to allow Australia to capitalise on market opportunities, he said.  The sugar industry needed a coordinated, cost-effective approach to funding, priorities and management and greater accountability by research organisations to ensure its investment reflected the industry's needs, he said.Continued improvement in productivity and efficiency was vital if the Australian industry was to maintain its competitive edge in an increrasingly tough world market, Bonanno said.It would be false economy for an export-dependent country like Australia to cut back on research, he said. Currently, about A$38 million was going into sugar research and development each year, or A$1.00 per tonne of cane, he said.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

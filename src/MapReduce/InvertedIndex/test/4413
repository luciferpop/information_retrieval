SWITZERLAND: U.S. reacts angrily to Indian nuclear veto.U.S. reacts angrily to Indian nuclear veto.The United States reacted angrily on Tuesday to India's formal veto of a nuclear test ban treaty and said it would work to bypass New Delhi's opposition and have the treaty adopted and signed anyway.After a meeting at which India confirmed its veto, U.S. disarmament ambassador Stephen Ledogar accused it of being "insincere" in its arguments against the test ban, telling reporters: "The real reason is that the current government in New Delhi wants to maintain the nuclear weapon option."  Earlier, India's Arundhati Ghose told the international Conference on Disarmament that her country could still not accept the treaty text, which it first vetoed in a negotiating committee last week.India, one of three nuclear "threshold states", says that the treaty should include a time-bound commitment by the five declared nuclear powers for total nuclear disarmament.Ledogar said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was never meant to be a nuclear disarmament pact until India decided last year that it should be so.He said the United States and other supporters of the treaty would act "in the next few days" to either have the draft treaty introduced to the U.N. General Assembly for signature late next month or would convene an international signature conference outside U.N. auspices.

CHILE: Chile to allow foreign firms to trade on bolsa.Chile to allow foreign firms to trade on bolsa.Chile will send a new law to Congress next month to allow foreign companies to trade on the Santiago bourse, said Securities Superintendent Daniel Yarur.The only restriction on companies that want to issue Chilean-style American Depositary Receipts is that they comply with regulations, Yarur told reporters."All those companies which fulfill the rules which we establish (can trade)," he said."We could think of Latin American companies, Latin American stocks and also other developed countries which may find it attractive to trade here," he said.The move will be one of the first steps toward fulfilling Chile's long-held ambition to become a regional financial center.-- Margaret Orgill, Santiago Newsroom 562-699-5595 x212

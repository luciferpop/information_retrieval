SINGAPORE: SIMEX Nikkei futures end firm, eyes on FOMC, Dow.SIMEX Nikkei futures end firm, eyes on FOMC, Dow.SIMEX Nikkei futures recovered from an early decline to end slightly firmer on Tuesday, but dealers said the market would take its cue from Wall Street's reaction to the Federal Reserve policy-making meeting tonight.The Fed is widely expected to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged, which should give a boost to the Dow, and consequently the Nikkei, dealers said."Everyone's following the U.S. markets at the moment," said a dealer with a U.S. institution.  After hitting a low of 21,000, the benchmark Nikkei 225 September contract ended five points off its high of 21,210 against a previous settlement at 21,190. Volume was slightly above the average seen in recent days at about 15,300 lots."A recovery from quite a big dip is always good, but this was nothing dramatic," said the dealer.-- Sonali Desai (65-8703090)

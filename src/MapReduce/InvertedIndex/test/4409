AUSTRIA: OMV unconcerned by U.S. Libya sanctions.OMV unconcerned by U.S. Libya sanctions.Austrian oil group OMV AG reiterated on Tuesday that it was unaffected by a controversial U.S. law imposing sanctions on firms that do business with Libya and said it doubted that the legislation would survive."The law does not affect us. It does not affect our long-standing contracts and our new investments do not exceed the $40 million (a year) limit," chief executive Richard Schenz told a news conference.Earlier this month U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Iran-Libyan Sanctions Act, which lets the United States penalise non-U.S. firms that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil and natural gas sectors of Iran or Libya."We will consider (the law) in future but it is questionnable whether the Americans will be able to sustain it long term, given EU opposition to their "world sheriff" approach," Schenz said.OMV, which is seeking to double its Libyan oil production to about 20,000 barrels per day, has said it is sticking to plans to develop the Murzuk oilfield along with France's Total and Spain's Repsol. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254

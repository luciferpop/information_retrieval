MALAYSIA: Bank Negara borrows 1-mth deposit at 6.95-7.05 pct.Bank Negara borrows 1-mth deposit at 6.95-7.05 pct.Bank Negara Malaysia said it borrowed for a one-month deposit from the interbank market at 6.95 to 7.05 percent against 6.95 previously.The borrowing was part of the central bank's open market operations. Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the local interbank market to keep a check on liquidity or set interest rates as part of its efforts to fight inflation.But, it has not been in the market for nearly three months despite rising liquidity that has pressured rates downward, threatening to thwart the Bank's tight monetary policy.It was last in the market on May 24.  Money market dealers said the intervention indicated that Bank Negara has not eased its tight monetary policy.While the volume that Bank Negara took was not known, it was expected to give a psychological boost to interest rates, particularly for short-term rates, dealers said."Rates are already firming up at the short-end. But, we don't know what the impact is going to be," one dealer said.He said rates of up to one-month had gone up by five to 10 basis points immediately after Bank Negara's announcement.- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-230 8911)

Australian bonds eased back from the day's highs amid some profit-taking after a steep rally had taken yields to the lowest level since March 1994, but sentiment remained extemely positive ahead of the Federal budget.Treasurer Peter Costello is due to hand down the budget to parliament at 7.30 p.m. (0930 GMT), and hopes remain high for a market-friendly statement. June quarter GDP data will be released simultaneously with the budget.The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) trading floor will reopen for a special budget session from 7.00 to 8.15 p.m. (0900 to 1015 GMT).  The market raced ahead in early trading, extending Monday's 16 basis point rally, and took the Sepetmber 10-year bond futures contract to 92.135, or just below 7.90 percent on the November 2006 physical bond."I must admit I was surprised at this market's strength, and having gone so far, so fast I suspect we start to run into some pressure once we get into high-teens to 92.20 area (on the 10-year bond contract) after the budget," one trader said.Costello is expected to announce spending cuts of at least A$4.0 billion as the first stage in bringing the budget back into balance by 1998/99.  The Treasurer and Prime Minister John Howard both reiterated that the budget would pave the way for more interest rate cuts.This kept a bid tone running in bill futures for much of the day, and took the active December contract to a high of 93.44 at one stage, indicating a cash rate of 6.56 percent at maturity compared with current 7.0 percent official interest rates.Meanwhile, the firm local trend took the Australian/U.S. 10-year bond spread down to its lowest level in over two years, but there was some resistance in breaching 130 basis points this side of the budget, traders said.  -----------------------(SPREADS)---------------------------- AUD VS   3-YR	   10-YR	* AUD 3-YR/10-YR SPREAD USD	 90 (- 07)   135 (- 05) * FUTURES   76   (+ 02) CAD	124 (+ 02)    67 (- 02) * CASH	89   (+ 01) NZD     -111 (+ 07)   -17 (+ 09) *------------------------------------------------------------U.S. bonds steadied in Tokyo after the soft close in New York ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but no change in policy is expected.

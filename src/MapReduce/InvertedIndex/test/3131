ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwe industrials fall on key stock losses.Zimbabwe industrials fall on key stock losses.Zimbabwean industrial shares continued active on Tuesday, but losses in some key counters dragged the main industrial index 15.06 points lower to 5,517.66.Dealers noted that 20-, 10-, and 40-cent losses in Tobacco Sales Limited (TSL) at 340, cement producer Circle Cement at 670 and multi-industrial group Radar at 140 outweighed gains recorded by several stocks, including bluechip conglomerate Delta which climbed 10 cents to 2,610.The dealers however expect the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to stay on a bullish path on strong foreign interest.The secondary seven-share mining index slipped 1.96 points to 1,248.17, partly weakened by a 15-cent loss in coal producer Wankie which traded at 285.-- Cris Chinaka, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9

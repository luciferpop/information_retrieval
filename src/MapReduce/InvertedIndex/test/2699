Operators expected any Bank of Finland easing to be small and undramatic and on the forex market, recent industry calls for a markka link to the ERM were seen more of a cap on the markka upside than central bank action.The markka closed slightly weaker vs the mark and the dollar but sentiment remained strong in the near term."The markka is likely to start testing the magic 3.0 mark level again," one forex dealer said.-- Paivi Mattila, Helsinki Newsroom +358 - 0 - 680 50 292

GERMANY: German SPD calls for cut in Bundesbank rates.German SPD calls for cut in Bundesbank rates.A cut in German interest rates is overdue, said Ingrid Matthaeus Maier, deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition Social Democrats on Tuesday."In view of the nearly four million officially registered unemployed and the anaemic recovery, a cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank is overdue," Maier said in a statement released ahead of Thursday's central bank council meeting."Business and consumers are waiting for such a signal."Stable prices and moderate wage agreements have eliminated any fear of reigniting inflation, and low interest rates should be the reward for wage restraint, she said.A cut in interest rates would stimulate demand for capital and consumer goods, and benefit German exports as well, she said.The Bundesbank last cut its discount rate on April 19, to a historic low 2.5 percent. It has kept its main money market rate, the repo rate, fixed at 3.3 percent since February.Markets widely expect some cut in the repo rate at Thursday's meeting.-- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49 228 2609750

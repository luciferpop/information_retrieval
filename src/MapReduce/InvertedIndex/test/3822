USA: Georgia tax glitches not a credit issue - official.Georgia tax glitches not a credit issue - official.Glitches in Georgia's sales tax distribution to local government should not immediately affect credit ratings because the revenues are not pledged to bonds, the chairman of a finance officers' group said."I don't think it's anything to do with the creditworthiness of the communities at this time. A continued problem in that area, I think, would be of concern to all of us," said Clarke County Manager Al Crace, who chairs a committee set up by the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia and the Georgia Municipal Association to work out a solution with revenue officials.State Auditor Claude Vickers reported in June that the Revenue Department had guessed how much to pay local governments in sales tax revenues over a 14-month period ending in May, resulting in over- and underpayments.Revenue Commissioner Marcus Collins, who will retire Sept 1, said a glitch in an outdated computer system prevented the department from properly calculating the distributions.In addition to the four percent statewide sales tax, the revenue department collects and distributes the fifth cent local-option tax that 153 of Georgia's 159 counties use to fund general operations. It also collects the sixth cent special purpose tax that as many as 80 local governments use at any given time to fund capital improvements."These are not state funds. They're an administrator handling our money," Crace said. "We have no confidence that there's been a fair division among those taxes. We're receiving monthly checks, which we appreciate. But we can't relate that to any time period or any clear-cut process."Crace said on some rare occasions the local government share of the money is pledged to pay off tax anticipation notes with maturities under five years. But generally the capital improvement money is not leveraged, he said."Most of the time they can't design it, build it and spend it faster than it comes in," Crace said.His group urged lawmakers to require an annual outside audit of the state Revenue Department, set up a permanent oversight board, improve professional training of revenue department staff and require the department to return tax revenues to local governments within a specified period.Crace's group will offer the recommendations in a package of draft legislation this fall and will ask the General Assembly to adopt them when it meets in January.The group volunteered to work with a task force being assembled by Gov Zell Miller to solve the problem and to help set up computer programs to track the revenues better. Most local government officers use equipment and programs far more sophisticated than the ancient program used by the revenue department, Crace said."We're in for the long haul. This problem could occur again and again if they dont' fix that system," Crace said.Cobb County already sued to collect alleged underpayments from the revenue department, but Crace said his group hoped to avoid lawsuits and find "a friendly solution.""Litigation will only deal with legal instruction to resolve past problems. It will not prevent the further risk," he said.--Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013

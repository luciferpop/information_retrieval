September settled 2.35 cents off at 90.90 cents with spot August down 2.25 cents at 91.20 cents.Richard Hirsch of Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals said COMEX closed significantly higher than LME on Monday therefore some of the gains had to be given up on Tuesday's opening."We are locked in a rigid sideways range pattern - once again after rallying above the congestion on Monday we fell back into it sharply," Hirsch said.Trading was routine with little fresh news. LME stocks rose 5,000 tonnes to 226,000 tonnes, in line with market expectations.-- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646

Futures closed 0.500 cent higher to 0.275 lower with October off 0.100 at 71.275 cents per lb.Packers stepped up bids by $2 per cwt for fed cattle and cattle feeders responded by selling at the $68 level. But futures failed to rise further after setting new highs as the sharp premium of futures to cash encouraged profit taking."Live cattle (futures) have got a decent premium built in and its just wait-and-see time if cash is going to continue to improve," said Doug Harper, Brock Associates Inc Senior Lievestock analyst.Cash cattle prices will likely stay at current levels until after Friday's monthly USDA Cattle-on-Feed report, traders added. Early estimates on the report ranged from 84 to 88 percent of a year ago for total Aug 1 on-feed numbers in the seven major feedlot states.  July placement estimates ranged 100 to 116 percent of a year ago and July marketings 100.5 to 106 percent.ADM Investor Services, Lind-Waldock, LFG and Rosenthal Collins sold October late while Refco and RBH bought, pit sources said.In live cattle options, selling of deep in the money calls in October early, was noted.

However, futures showed most of their weakness in the last few minutes of trade as a fairly large sell order in November sparked a break into the close.Selling by LFG in November touched off sell stops in that month and locals turned sellers in nearbys. The stops took November down the daily limit to 63.000 cents in its closing range while other months broke to new days lows, traders said.Smith Barney, ADM Investor Services and R.J. O'Brien sold October early while ING and locals bought, traders said.

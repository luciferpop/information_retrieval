AUSTRALIA: RTRS - Costello says budget passage sets up rate cut.RTRS - Costello says budget passage sets up rate cut.Treasurer Peter Costello said that if the government's 1996/97 budget was passed by the Senate, the upper house of parliament, such passage would set up an interest rate cut."If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy," Costello said.Asked whether there would be another interest rate cut before the end of calendar 1996, he said: "I'd like that to be an outcome and I am going to do the best to make sure we are going to get it"."A good budget passed through the Senate, fiscal consolidation, we can set the conditions (for another rate cut)," Costello said.  The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official cash rates to 7.00 percent from 7.50 percent on July 31.-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

RUSSIA: Russian air traffic controllers see Aug 27 strike.Russian air traffic controllers see Aug 27 strike.Russian flight controllers and ground workers plan to strike over a pay dispute from August 27, an air traffic controllers' union official said on Tuesday.Gennady Borisov, aide to the president of the Federation of Air Traffic Controller Unions, said regional unions and some Moscow controllers were ready to strike.Aviation unions called two strikes this year, but regional leaders declined to join, and the strikes were cancelled. Officials from state-owned Aeroflot and private airlines Transaero and Orient-Avia said their workers would not strike.Borisov said air traffic controllers at Moscow's Domodedovo, Vnukovo and Bykovo airports were ready to strike this time, but those at Sheremetyevo international airport had not decided.The workers want pay rises to take account of inflation, guarantees of job security and special payments for working in "dangerous conditions". Existing contracts expired on January 1 and negotiations broke down on July 31.Federal Aviation Service head Gennady Zaitsev said last week that the unions' demands were "unrealistic", since federal civial aviation services had no cash to spare.Interfax news agency this month quoted chief government negotiator Robert Suleimanov as saying the strike would fail because aviation workers would refuse to back the unions.Aeroflot deputy chief executive Valery Okulov said his airline's staff would not participate in the action."All flights on August 27 and the following days will be made according to Aeroflot's schedule," Okulov said.--Viktor Anoshkin, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

AUSTRALIA: Australia sees 96/7 A$5.65 bln budget deficit.Australia sees 96/7 A$5.65 bln budget deficit.The Australian government said in its budget on Tuesday it expected an underlying deficit in the year ended June 30, 1997 of A$5.65 billion, down from a A$10.32 billion deficit posted in 1995/96.The median economist forecast was for an underlying deficit number for 1996/97 of A$4.9 billion.The government said it expected the headline balance, which include asset sale proceeds and early debt repayments, to be in surplus by A$474 million in 1996/97, down from the A$5.05 billion deficit posted in 1995/96.  Economists had forecast a A$1.0 billion headline surplus for 1996/97.The government said the starting point underlying deficit for 1996/97 was A$9.56 billion, and that it would take spending and revenue measures which would produce a net reduction in the 1996/97 underlying deficit of A$3.90 billion.The starting point deficit is the Treasury's estimate of what the budget outcome would be without any policy change.This estimate is given to the government before the budget is constructed and includes the budget effects of Treasury's latest economic forecasts.  These deficit reduction measures included planned revenue increases worth A$979 million over the 1996/97 year and planned spending cuts worth A$2.929 billion over the year.This latest A$9.56 billion starting point compares with the A$7.64 billion starting point for 1996/97 announced on March 12 just after the new government's election.On July 16 the government announced a A$1.3 billion deterioration in the budget deficit for 1995/96 and Costello said the starting point for 1996/97 would worsen by about that amount.  The change in the starting point once that A$1.3 billion is taken into account implies economic forecast effects on the budget position of about minus A$660 million.Economists had a median forecast a A$8.9 billion starting point deficit for 1996/97.The government said it expected the underlying deficit to fall to A$1.55 billion in 1997/98 and then turn into a surplus of A$957 million in 1998/99.It said its budget measures announced on Tuesday would reduce the underlying deficit by A$7.15 billion by the end of 1997/98.  The government said immediately after its election in March that it wanted to make A$8 billion worth of budget cuts over the 1996/97 and 1997/98 years, aiming for balance in 1997/98.					 1995/96   1996/97   1997/981998/99A$ billionUnderlying budget balance  -10.317   -5.649    -1.548   +0.957Headline budget balance     -5.045   +0.474    +6.638   n/aStarting point balance	-9.970   -9.558    -8.702   -5.414Economists forecast (underlying)     -4.9Economists forecast (headline)	 +1.0Economists (starting point)	    -8.9-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

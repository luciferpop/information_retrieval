USA: Vermont's unemployment rate in July edges up again.Vermont's unemployment rate in July edges up again.Vermont on Tuesday said that its unemployment rate in July edged up one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.2 percent, the third month in a row that the gauge has risen, but the state dismissed the latest rise."The increase is modest, however, and fundamental labor market conditions remained unchanged," said Susan Auld, the commissioner of Vermont's Department of Employment and Training, in prepared remarks.Out of a total labor force of 323,100 people, approximately 309,500 people were working in July.In June, when the unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent, about 13,100 people were employed out of a total workforce of 321,900.In July 1995, when the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent, there were about 305,300 people working out of a total labor force of 319,000, the state department said.Unemployment rates for Vermont's 13 labor markets ranged from as low as 1.7 percent in Hartford-Lebanon to as high as 6.7 percent in Newport. These data, unlike the preceeding numbers, were not seasonally adjusted.--Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654

"I have always said -- and the Reserve Bank made this clear -- that if we have a good budget through the Senate and if we have a programme to get Australia out of deficit and debt reduction, that will take the pressure off interest rates," Costello said in a radio interview.He remark follows his presentation of the budget to parliament on Tuesday night.The budget slashes a net A$2.9 billion from spending and boosts revenues by a net A$1 billion to bring down the forecast underlying budget deficit to A$5.65 billion in 1996/97.  Costello and Prime Minister John Howard both said in the lead-up to the budget's presentation that the government's aim to cut debt and eliminate the budget deficit would make another interest rate cut more likely.The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its official cash rate by 50 basis points last month.-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

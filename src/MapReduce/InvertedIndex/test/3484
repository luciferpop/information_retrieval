"If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy," Costello said."A good budget passed through the Senate, fiscal consolidation, we can set the conditions (for another rate cut)," Costello said.The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official cash rates to 7.00 percent from 7.50 percent on July 31.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

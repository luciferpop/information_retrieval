SWEDEN: Swedes say no to EMU - poll.Swedes say no to EMU - poll.A majority of Swedes are opposed to Sweden joining the European Monetary Union (EMU), a survey by a national pollster said on Tuesday.The Swedish Institute of Public Opinion Research (SIFO) said the poll found 56 percent of Swedes did not want their country to join the EMU while only 21 percent were in favour. The rest were undecided.Over 61 percent of supporters of Sweden's ruling Social Democrat Party were against joining the EMU and only 17 percent in favour of the move."The SDP, which is to deal with the EMU question in its 1997 autumn congress, has a very critical opinion to take into account," said Swedish daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, as it reported the findings of the poll.Dagens Nyheter said Sweden's main opposition party, the centre-right Moderates, is officially in favour of joining the EMU but will have an uphill battle to convince its supporters.Only 40 percent of Moderate supporters were in favour of EMU and 35 percent were against, according to the SIFO poll.Almost one quarter of the 1,000 Swedes questioned by telephone this month had never heard of the EMU, said SIFO.-- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017

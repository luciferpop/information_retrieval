LATVIA: Nordic ministers back Baltics for NATO.Nordic ministers back Baltics for NATO.Foreign ministers from the Nordic countries said on Tuesday they supported efforts by the Baltic states to get into NATO.Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia quit the former Soviet Union in 1991 and have all applied for membership of the alliance as they remain fearful of huge neighbour Russia.Ruled by Moscow for most of the last 200 years, they want strong security guarantees against any resurgence of Russian expansionism."There is no doubt about our support for the Baltic states' membership of NATO," Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, whose country is a member of the military alliance, told a news conference.He was speaking after talks between foreign ministers from Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland and Denmark and their Baltic counterparts. Denmark and Iceland are also NATO members.Russia has been angered by Baltic efforts to join NATO as it remains sensitive to any expansion of its former Cold War foe.The Baltic states also had huge strategic importance in the Soviet defence system and were packed with military bases.But Western diplomats say the Balts have little chance of joining NATO in a first round of enlargement."No matter what happens it is the job of all of us to keep the Baltic security issue on the international agenda," Danish Foreign Minister Nils Helveg Petersen said.Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, whose country maintains a policy of neutrality, said she respected the wish of the Baltic states to join NATO.

UK: IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings.IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings.European credit rating agency IBCA said on Tuesday it affirmed its long-term foreign currency debt rating of Italy at AA minus and said the country may have finally turned the corner in its battle for fiscal reform."The rating applies to $92.9 billion of senior and unsecured foreign currency debt obligations of the Republic and sets a ceiling for the foreign currency rating of all Italian entities," IBCA said in a statement.IBCA also confirmed its rating of A1 plus for short-term foreign currency issues and assigned a long-term local currency rating of AAA to sovereign debt."The small reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio in 1995 - the first since 1980 - signals a possible turning point in Italy's problematic fiscal policy," the agency said.But IBCA said the path would not be easy."A relatively small adverse shift in the macroeconomic environment will be sufficient to blow the government's public debt to gdp projections off course," it said. "IBCA is projecting that the public debt to GDP ratio will rise this year, although it should fall in the more favourable macroeconomic environment expected in 1997."In July, rating agency Moody's Investors Service raised its foreign currency sovereign ceiling rating on Italy to Aa3 from A1. In late April, Standard & Poor's affirmed its AA foreign currency rating for Italy.IBCA said Italy had considerable strengths as a sovereign credit. These were illustrated by "the continued dynamism" of the private sector, a current account surplus and a high savings ratio. "These aspects of the economy have allowed Italy to sustain high public debt without having to draw on foreign savings," it said.

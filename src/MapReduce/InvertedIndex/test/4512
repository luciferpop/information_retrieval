"Overall it's well-bid on the back of the Australian dollar's strength," said one dealer, adding renewed Samurai interest, plus pre-budget buying, were the main drivers.In the New Zealand dollar, Asian buying was acting as a key support.The sale by the Government of Forestry Corp -- its second largest privatisation -- did little to move the currency.Support for the Kiwi is expected at 0.6900 but formidable resistance was seen building at 0.6940."It looks pretty dangerous at 0.6940 so it might spike higher if it breaks that level," he said.
